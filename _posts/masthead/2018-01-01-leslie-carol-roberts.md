Leslie Carol Roberts’ writing focuses on exploration of place, how humans design interactions with the wild, and story, through research and personal story. She has been a Fulbright Fellow in English and Antarctic Studies, a Fulbright Travel Grant recipient, as well as grants from the NEA and others.  Her most recent book is _Here Is Where I Walk: Episodes from a Life in the Forest_, from University of Nevada Press (2019). Her essay, “The Entire Earth and Sky,” was included in the anthology _On Nature_ from Penguin Tarcher and evolved into her first book of the same name, published by University of Nebraska Press. With the designer Jennifer Morla, she edited  _Morla: On Design_ (Letterform Archive, 2018.) She is currently working on a book about language, love, and the Antarctic, exploring how environmental activists shaped and reiterated the language of exceptionalism in their fight to save Antarctica.
