Earlier in 2019, the United Nations showcased Oceanix, a floating city, framing it with these facts: By 2030, approximately 60 percent of the world’s population will live in cities that are exposed to grave economic, social, and environmental pressures. Further, approximately 90 percent of the largest global cities are vulnerable to rising sea levels. Out of the world’s 22 megacities with a population of more than 10 million, 15 are located along the ocean’s coasts.

<br>

Ecological refugees are nothing new: Throughout human history, there have been humans and nonhumans forced away from sacred and familiar lands by floods. Visions of a floating future include the Libertarian Seasteaders out of the Silicon Valley. What is different this time is that we will see refugees on a planetary scale. Did you catch the Climate Central data released in October, depicting revised coastlines and generously covered by The New York Times? 

<br>

After five years of collaboration, architects, scientists, materials experts, and architecture students at CCA’s Architectural Ecologies Lab launched the Buoyant Ecologies Float Lab into San Francisco Bay, offering nonhuman habitats to counter ecologies threatened by the rising seas of climate catastrophe.

<br>

It’s the first step for the Float Lab, which imagines expanding the concept to include humans at home and at work and at play. The first Buoyant Ecologies Float Lab officially launched in September, 2019, moored into place on the Oakland side of San Francisco Bay. Designed as a home for sea urchins, oysters, mussels, and other marine invertebrates, the structure dubbed “Miranda,” is about 14 feet by 8 feet. The hull is fabricated from fiber-reinforced polymer composite, an ecologically optimized material. Weighing in at 500 pounds, another 1,200 pounds of concrete ballast help ensure proper buoyancy.

The grander vision for the future? Perhaps human-scaled versions linked together as a way for humans and nonhumans to hold position with these changing ecologies.

Developing the Form Factors

<br>

These full-scale substrate prototypes are designed to function as what scientists call an “upside down reef” -- and the task for the architects was to figure out what form this took. There were myriad possibilities and biological reefs offered some clues.

Float Lab en Rose

The Float Lab is a collaboration with Moss Landing Marine Science Benthic Lab and Kreysler Associates, the legendary fiberglass fabricators.

Prototyping Options

<br>

Options for substrate forms were tested along the California coast, to see how they would be populated with marine plants and animals. The “ecologically optimized” material can be digitally formed into varied contours—“underwater topographies”— that encourage the settlement of invertebrate animals that “contribute to the biological diversity of the marine ecology.”

Monitoring the Substrate Underwater

Prototypes of the ecologically optimized substrates informed the design of the Float Lab’s contoured hull.

Miranda Floating on the Bay

<br>

The final form of the floating structure has been described by its designers as akin to a “sailboat without a mast.”

Montage

This montage of images shows design details, including  marine hardware and a solar panel that powers the Float Lab’s bilge and irrigation pumps..

Caption: What Lies Beneath


Two images of plants and animals beginning to make themselves at home. Using peaks and valleys on both sides of the structure—produced in two identical halves to minimize the waste of producing custom molds—of varying sizes, the Lab features “fish apartments” supplied by nutrients from plankton and other invertebrates that are carried along by flowing water.
