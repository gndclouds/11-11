The family dog found one of the bunnies we were raising running loose in the yard, and took it
up in its jaws—but my stepmother caught the German Shepherd almost at once, and pried the
damp panicked baby (whole body pulsing with its heartbeat) out. The rescued animal, paralyzed
by terror, was given to me to hold, and I sat with it on my lap a while, in my bedroom—taking
advantage of its perfect stillness to be, as I wanted to be, close. Soft and warm, but completely
unresponsive (eyes everywhere, gaze nowhere), as if nothing of what came after coming so near
to death could register or count. We sat like that together in the aftermath for what felt like a long
time, and gradually the frantic panting slowed. Then the rabbit kicked and leapt down to the floor
—and began to race around the edges of the room, screaming. I had had no idea it could make a
sound like that: a high-pitched horrible thin urgent wailing that went on and on and on…until it
ran out. In the silence afterward the animal seemed not to know what had happened or rather it
was as if nothing had happened: it was just a rabbit, again, and quiet. It didn’t want to be held but
it also had no fierce objection: it wanted a carrot or clover, some food pellets maybe, the
company of others like itself. The hutch? Back in it went: caged and (for awhile) safe. I don’t
 know what happened after that. There remains a space inside me where that sound continues,
<i>Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee,</i> and the animal goes thumping around and along the baseboards. When I
 asked myself what I wanted to say about this project, I recalled that moment. What I want to tell
you is this: I didn’t write these poems—they <i>escaped</i> me.
