<br><br>
If the men she walks past
<br>
Make comments Nice tits
<br>
Nice ass shake it baby etc
<br>
She laughs and says it’s just
<br>
Their way of saying hello
<br>
To her as their way of saying
<br>
Hello to Bill or Pill were she
<br>
With her husband would be
<br>
An admiring but respectful
<br>
Silence she thinks it’s nice
<br>
To be noticed doesn’t see
<br>
Why the things they’re
<br>
Saying freak me out _Don’t_
<br>
_Have a cow_ she thinks
<br>
I must be jealous as we
<br>
Walk in a kind of hot
<br>
Tunnel of glances and
<br>
On-going commentary that’s
<br>
Only she explains her due
<br>
Just a sign of appreciation
<br>
Nice pot-roast sexy rib-eye
<br>
Awesome flank steak mama
<br>
C’mon my filet mignon
<br>
