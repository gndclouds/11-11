In the real
<br>
Or the consensually
<br>
Recognized—but
<br>
Flees (for reasons
<br>
We may or may not
<br>
Know) to be exiled.
<br>
Nomad, cosmopolitan,
<br>
Refugee. Not Expat
<br>
Exactly not that
<br>
Timid and judgmental:
<br>
Estranged, yes—
<br>
But desperately.
<br>
The imaginary
<br>
Emerges as
<br>
“Sacred,” homeless,
<br>
Caught at the edge
<br>
Of the country
<br>
It used to call home
<br>
And the country
<br>
Which might bear
<br>
The name of home
<br>
A while. I see you
<br>
The imagination says
<br>
I see you seeing
<br>
Me. Stepping out
<br>
Into the lack of father-
<br>
Land. I see you:
<br>
Tenderly,
<br>
Remorselessly.
<br>
