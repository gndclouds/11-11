<br><br>
If you live in your car, I don’t have to worry about you not being able to pay rent
<br>
If you eat scraps from a dumpster, I don’t have to worry about you stealing food
<br>
You don’t deserve to put in your misery-filled mouth and fumble down with rotting teeth
<br>
If you find temporary employment in a warehouse so big that no one knows your name
<br>
I don’t have to worry about you thinking your life is shit
<br>
Others with nametags will help you reach that conclusion
<br>
And if they still have any brains resting inside their misshapen skulls
<br>
They will inform you that you should have been left out in the rain
<br>
Because you didn’t save for a rainy day
<br>
It’s the American way – everyone gets what he or she merits
<br>
You got here on your own, didn’t you?
<br>
Down the path of the fallen
<br>
Is it my fault that you failed spectacularly at being human?
<br>
That you became another blooming eyesore on this great nation’s scrubbed face
<br>
There is a good reason that you were drubbed and you know
<br>
Deep in your worm-filled heart that you got what you earned
<br>
If you live in your car, I don’t have to worry about where you will sleep at night
<br>
If you live in your car, I won’t have to concern myself
<br>
With where you will be found
<br>
Once you are dead
<br>
Another petty thought that takes up too much of my precious day
<br>
When I have the untrammeled happiness of my constituents to think about
<br>
If you live in your car, I don’t have to worry about the next election
<br>
Because you will be gone, one way or another
<br>
