Is a title that lies
<br>
All alone on a blank
<br>
Page see you can’t
<br>
See her here she’s
<br>
Rawhide hiding
<br>
Far and wide but we
<br>
Hear here her murmur
<br>
_Oh I hate this notoriety_
<br>
<br>
This body-shaped
<br>
Absence my body
<br>
<br>
Elsie the C flings
<br>
Her skirts up over
<br>
Her face when faced
<br>
With the paparazzi
<br>
_Were you_ she asks
<br>
Eagerly _looking_
<br>
Her voice slightly
<br>
Muffled _for me_
<br>
