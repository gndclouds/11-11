A certain type of light illumines
<br>
and yet that word is lost.
<br>
It could be a hearse
<br>
but it is too short
<br>
and sporty.
<br>
The door is glue blue.
<br>
That's what comes to mind. Illness.
<br>
The blue door is at the bottom
<br>
of the brown building to mark
<br>
an entrance.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The breeze. The trees oblige.
<br>
Be still. Appease
<br>
my heart
<br>
my
<br>
nerve
<br>
long
<br>
gone.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

They ask if I’ll put them in the ground,
<br>
if I’ll put myself in the ground.
<br>
If I stare at two buildings I won't go anywhere
<br>
but below is what looks like brush,
<br>
wiry plants slanting where the sun
<br>
ascends. Miraculously all remainstill, though her cry tilts the words
<br>
so slightly. The leaning tower
<br>
appears; the cry
<br>
subsides.
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
To be about this. Resistance bites.
<br>
I stretch into limits.
<br>
The wall of green sprawls. Each at its own.
<br>
The green holds light refracting.
<br>
Blinded by
<br>
a mind's
<br>
eye.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
To want to hold it.
<br>
Raging at you though pursuit is futile. That raging sea, desire.
<br>
Three new mouths shot from above
<br>
the nest sharpening its beak.
<br>
Satiation strung from the building-scape.
<br>
The work will wait and work while waiting.
<br>
It becomes about death around now.
<br>
_Oh_ _you._
<br>
To affix the loss away from.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
"Buuuhrd." The bird house sits transmitting light.
<br>
What a sight the sky. Those are clouds.
<br>
A brown vine straggles. Giggle.
<br>
But why think progressively. A habit
<br>
of the human, you mean "hum." I'm done with moving fast. At last, alas. Your curls
<br>
all atopple. That tree a steeple.
<br>
What would one do with names of species?
<br>
The science blinks
<br>
at the scientist's swagger.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Who are the bad guys raise your hand.
<br>
Well understandably you can't acquire assertiveness just by thinking. The milky sky retreats and she
<br>
eats words. However one might be listening the atmosphere glistens.
<br>
"Is that photo of her dying?" "No. she's alive and smiling." A kind of treaty to attend to
<br>
this penning of what's heard. The blank
<br>
stare stamps, what's out there
<br>
seized.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
An elegant sheet of rain exquisite in its glow. "Where are you?"
<br>
"Where do the animals go?"
<br>
Nature droops weighted from water and yet more beautiful "Which outfit is prettier?"
<br>
Neon pink and silver lines drown the peeping leaves. Aware and noting material is barely responding.
<br>
Aware the end is near.
<br>
Not a sheet of rain but shiny pane of glass.
