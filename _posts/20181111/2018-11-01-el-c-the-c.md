This image of her peeing
<br>
Into the many open mouths
<br>
Of her auditors is a painting
<br>
On black velvet the souvenir
<br>
Of a long ago honeymoon
<br>
“Across the border” the runs
<br>
A serape and a tiny bright tableau
<br>
Of musical skeleton lined up
<br>
As if applying for work
<br>
Or hoping to be paid as if
<br>
Anxiety in the afterlife is
<br>
Cheery bag of bloody-
<br>
Looking dried mango dusted
<br>
With chili and this large
<br>
Artwork in which the arc
<br>
Of that gold liquid goes up
<br>
To come down on (like
<br>
A cow pissing on a flat
<br>
Cliché) the glitter-flecked
<br>
Wet ruby red lips open
<br>
(these gaping spectators)
<br>
Like so many zeros after
<br>
A number the number
<br>
Becomes meaningless
<br>
As the title _Deficit_
<br>
Comercial with an upside
<br>
Down exclamation
<br>
Mark it was a “bargain”
<br>
Of course I meant
<br>
At the beginning
<br>
To say _peering_
<br>
_Mira_ a miracle it all
<br>
Seems so cheap
<br>
