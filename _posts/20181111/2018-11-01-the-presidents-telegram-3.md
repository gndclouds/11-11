<br><br>
There are no words to express
<br>
the horrible horrific happened
<br><br>
Journalists, like all fear,
<br>
should be attacked while doing their jobs
<br><br>
To the families of the violently, there are victims
<br>
to express protect reduce regret your loss
<br><br>
There are jobs to pledge eternal support
<br>
our horrible, horrible sorrow
<br><br>
When you are suffering
<br>
we pledge warmest Best Wishes
<br><br>
I’ve seen families express great sorrow
<br>
for your eternal suffering
<br>
