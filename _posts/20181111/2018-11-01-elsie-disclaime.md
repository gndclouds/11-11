Isn’t my invention
<br>
She’s really a real
<br>
“Character” her father
<br>
Art in advertising or
<br>
Urology but everything
<br>
Absolutely _everything_
<br>
About her is purely
<br>
Imaginary and any
<br>
Resemblance to actual
<br>
People living or dead
<br>
Is accidental my father
<br>
Collected chairs
<br>

<br>
Designed a better
<br>
Light she adds
<br>
Lifting her legs
<br>

<br>
Confidentially
