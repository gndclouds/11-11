Elsie the C
<br>
Is, you understand,
<br>
Just an opening—
<br>
An opportunity.
<br>
<br>
Both her names
<br>
End with eeeeeeee:
<br>
So if you even
<br>
Say hello
<br>
You’re squealing.
<br>
<br>
And everything
<br>
(My lawyers insist
<br>
I add this) in these
<br>
Poems is completely
<br>
Imaginary—even
<br>
The refugees.
