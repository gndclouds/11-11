&nbsp;
I do this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do that
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hard drive hums a different tune
<br><br>
More of a growl really
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orphan files recovered
<br><br>
not unlike&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tips of text
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the top or bottom of page
<br>
<br>
Please wait while this page restarts Dear lovely cursor
<br>
<br>
little line
<br>
from which somehow letters leap forth
<br>
out of which words
<br>
<br>
warp & wave
<br>
& wiggle
<br>
as certain
<br>
as gravity to a waterfall
<br>
here deep in the forest
<br>
Too much Saturn not enough moon
<br>
We knew
<br>
not only that you like
<br>
to ‘pop’ your knuckles
<br>
from Parrot Eyes Lust
<br>
Ron Silliman
<br>
For Elliot Helfer
<br>
but that you do so ‘inside out’ center fingers first
<br>
alternating
<br>
from one hand to the next
<br>
then pointer
<br>
then ring finger
<br>
birds loud in the canopy
<br>
not a hint of the squirrels
<br>
I see one robin
<br>
fat on the lawn
<br>
hard copy is
<br>
at least truthier
<br>
Spot right at the soffit’s edge
<br>
where invariably I hit my head
<br>
Old iron wind chimes
<br>
you can smell the rust
<br>
The rest is time
<br>
already at dawn
<br>
I hear someone’s sprinklers
<br>
Lavender hydrangea
<br>
up against the fence
<br>
Squirrel among birdcalls
<br>
Kiss of the hummingbird
<br>
Who in that house all those kids
<br>
(not seen)
<br>
the girls & their boyfriends reads a book?
<br>
Rabbit in the road
<br>
Last night the first June bugs tonight even more
<br>
Little concrete stupa
<br>
 hidden behind hastas
 <br>
Newspaper ungathered at the driveway’s base
<br>
Pulp of the banana slides down the esophagus
<br>
great lake
<br>
of stomach bacteria
<br>
awaits
<br>
That clicking, kissing sound is the squirrels
<br>
hum of the first weekend pilot
<br>
Sun suddenly
<br>
casts its shadow
<br>
Hundreds of tiny flying things
<br>
so small
<br>
you wouldn’t even notice
<br>
but for this
<br>
moment of illumination
<br>
Dog’s moan
<br>
so particular I even know
<br>
which dog
<br>
now, somewhere in the mix a rock dove coos
I know who he was
<br>
but never really read him
<br>
didn’t notice
<br>
that he’d disappeared
<br>
let alone that you’d died
<br>
now, 21 years later these brilliant poems shimmer in the light
<br>
“pain free”
<br>
I hear my son yawn two rooms away
<br>
The rain appears to have stopped
<br>
but that bird’s returned with its 5-note song
<br>
Dear Philip,
<br>
it’s 5:03 AM
<br>
nine hours west of here
<br>
three hours west of Hawai’i
<br>
I have to be careful now
<br>
at the sight of the slightest spider
<br>
It might be you
<br>
At dawn
<br>
one finds moths
<br>
gathered at the sink
<br>
This gigantic notebook
<br>
Gradually the poem unveils itself
<br>
<br>
 well not the light exactly this gray paper
 <br>
starting to darken with age
<br>
These beach houses furnished all alike
<br>
pastels too bright
<br>
seashell decorations
<br>
& the promise
<br>
of an outdoor shower
<br>
The “girl” at the market made me happy
<br>
with her Russian accent
<br>
The compost of America becoming that much more rich
<br>
The joints of my legs conjoin with the pelvis
<br>
where just to sit still is not entirely
<br>
 A pickup truck
 <br>
in whose bed stand
<br>
upright tied tight
<br>
(bright orange straps) a dozen glass doors
<br>
Today’s first jogger
<br>
heading west along the canal
<br>
on a side street the first power walker
<br>
heading south
<br>
Another jogger
<br>
(the first guy)
<br>
trotting thru these long shadows
<br>
he’s heading north
<br>
Nobody yet
<br>
walking their dog
<br>
tho I hear one
<br>
a few doors away
<br>
The one we call Psycho Dog loves to hurl himself
<br>
against the electronic fence
<br>
This jogger returns limping
<br>
O very pale golden lab
<br>
nose down
<br>
checking the odors
<br>
as it walks
<br>
Majestic blue heron threads the sky
<br>
Quick enough rain storm
<br>
but now all the lawn chairs are soaked
<br>
Quiet enough
<br>
I can hear the guy next door
<br>
talking on the phone
<br>

“Okay”
<br>
he says
<br>
accenting each syllable the second drawn out
<br>
nearly becomes two
<br>
An old cheese stick in the car just as good as ever
<br>
What are the lines
<br>
What are the words
<br>
I need
<br>
<br>
<br>
to make sense
<br>
<br>
of my life?
<br>
<br>
right at the edge
<br>
<br>
about to recognize a feeling
<br>
<br>
& you! meaning me
<br>
<br>
you had to jump right in you always do that
<br>
<br>
But it’s not I wanted to say later
<br>
<br>
driving the dark road north it’s not about feeling
<br>
<br>
Y has so many
<br>
<br>
he’s paralyzed by the weight of them
<br>
<br>
it’s about doing
<br>
<br>
he needs to do something
<br>
<br>
Anything at all
<br>
<br>
Giant yellow telescope at midtown highrise window
<br>
<br>
not for the sky
<br>
<br>
but to glimpse neighbors fucking
<br>
<br>
The lone skylight was in the second bathroom
<br>
<br>
A pile of towels where I hope to sit
<br>
<br>
hop to site
<br>
<br>
Oooh, scolds X,
<br>
<br>
he was right there
<br>
<br>
 How to position
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
the cycle of texts
<br>
like knowing
<br>
for each line
<br>
where to draw
<br>
the left margin
<br>
This howl is my Howl dog’s growl
<br>
inflected by wagging tail
<br>
Hail to the clef Cliff note
<br>
Smallest distance between beats of the heart
<br>
I saw my mother married only as a toddler
<br>
Try to fathom now
<br>
all the difference
<br>
that’s made
<br>
A tall page
<br>
to stand for ages Truman is still President
<br>
Tho I don’t yet know
<br>
quite what that means
<br>
If a fountain pen
<br>
where then is the fountain?
<br>
The soprano sings
<br>
Come All Ye Fair & Tender Maidens
<br>
while the baritone with somewhat less flash
<br>
intones On Top Of Old Smoky
<br>
the percussion quartet hyperactive but surprisingly quiet
<br>
more space between notes than within
<br>
What one hears decades on
<br>
will differ
<br>
 An auditorium filled with white hair
 <br>
(Who will hear George Crumb
<br>
once his generation’s gone?)
<br>
I don’t sculpt Google nor ogle giggles
<br>
but each letter is somehow carved
<br>
from what? from who?
<br>
from how
<br>
From here I look out on a room that my children
<br>
might imagine as primal as I do that one
<br>
gone so long ago
<br>
The television in the corner to the right of the fireplace
<br>
in front of a case
<br>
filled with books
<br>
The Big Book of Little Stanzas
<br>
including the one
<br>
I thought last night
<br>
to write
<br>
right here
<br>
Bowl of frozen meatballs microwaved
<br>
for my son’s breakfast
<br>
fills the air eau d’ meat
<br>
The great busyness of dreams does not survive
<br>
the violence
<br>
of the electronic toothbrush
<br>
placed in one’s head
<br>
What was I doing?
<br>
Am I doing it still?
<br>
Few & far between
<br>
expectations of privacy
<br>
2 hidden assumptions the line, the margin
<br>
An old song from World War I
<br>
By using a notebook, do I become quaint?
<br>
Magnetized hooks
<br>
on the side of the fridge
<br>
Some Civil War vets still were alive
<br>
when I was a child
<br>
The “paper boy”
<br>
is a middle-aged man
<br>
in a large sedan
<br>
Over There
<br>
 Some threat to the dream but vague
 <br>
& not immediate
<br>
So that all I recall
<br>
is the desert climate
<br>
warm but not oppressive the sun in great quantity
<br>
Word order in Turkish
<br>
matters far less
<br>
enabling different forms of play
<br>
Man bites dog well not quite
<br>
With that much room
<br>
I’d never back out of the driveway
<br>
The Age of Melted Wax
<br>
NCIS
<br>
not the agency
<br>
the show is all about
<br>

you could track the history
<br>
not just of
<br>
retail capital
<br>
but of technology itself through the rise
<br>
& later demise
<br>
of the video store
<br>
Tasteless “dots” marketed as
<br>
The Future of Ice Cream
<br>
The way the Beats distrusted
<br>
Ferlinghetti’s sense of business
<br>
while sending City Lights their manuscripts
<br>
Each sentence fills with sorrow
<br>
What if history itself should not endure?
<br>
Joe Brainard’s
<br>
Nancy as an ashtray
<br>
reflects a curious misogyny
<br>
A bias
<br>
in haiku
<br>
against titles
<br>
& long boots
<br>
Who reads
<br>
Rod McKuen now?
<br>
I climb the long stairs
<br>
to the floor on which
<br>
in the far rear corner they stock poetry
<br>
Outside, from a card table an old couple
<br>
sell plates from Iznik A young man pops in my face
<br>
The winter of short skirts
<br>
 to implore
 <br>
Will you save a mountain tonight?
<br>
