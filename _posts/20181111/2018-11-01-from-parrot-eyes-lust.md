 &nbsp;I do this
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do that
<br><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hard drive hums a different tune
<br><br>
 More of a growl really
<br><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orphan files recovered
<br><br>
 not unlike&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tips of text
<br>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear lovely cursor
<br>
<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;little line
<br>
<br>
 from which somehow letters leap forth
<br>
 out of which words
<br>
<br>
 warp & wave
<br>
<br>
 & wiggle
<br>
<br>
 as certain
<br>
 as gravity to a waterfall
<br>
<br>
 here deep in the forest
<br>
<br>
 Too much Saturn not enough moon
<br>
 We knew
<br>
<br>
 not only that you like
<br>
 to ‘pop’ your knuckles
<br>
 but that you do so ‘inside out’
<br>
 center fingers first
<br>
 alternating
<br>
 from one hand to the next
<br>
<br>
 then pointer
<br>
 then ring finger
<br>
<br>
 birds loud in the canopy
<br>
<br>
 not a hint of the squirrels
<br>
 I see one robin
<br>
 fat on the lawn
<br>
<br>
 hard copy is
<br>
 at least truthier
<br>
<br>
 Spot
<br>
 right at the soffit’s edge
<br>
 where invariably
<br>
 I hit my head
<br>
<br>
 Old iron wind chimes
<br>
 you can smell the rust
<br>
<br>
 The rest is time
<br>
<br>
 already at dawn
<br>
 I hear someone’s sprinklers
<br>
<br>
 Lavender hydrangea
<br>
 up against the fence
<br>
<br>
 Squirrel among birdcalls
<br>
<br>
 Kiss of the hummingbird (not seen)
<br>
<br>
 Who in that house
<br>
 all those kids
<br>
 the girls & their boyfriends
<br>
 reads a book?
 <br>
<br>
 Rabbit in the road
<br>
<br>
 Last night the first June bugs
<br>
 tonight even more
<br>
<br>
 Little concrete stupa
<br>
 hidden behind hastas
<br>
<br>
 Newspaper ungathered
<br>
 at the driveway’s base
<br>
<br>
 Pulp of the banana
<br>
 slides down the esophagus
<br>
 great lake
<br>
 of stomach bacteria
<br>
 awaits
<br>
<br>
 That clicking, kissing sound
<br>
 is the squirrels
<br>
<br>
 hum of the first
<br>
 weekend pilot
<br>
<br>
 Sun suddenly
<br>
 casts its shadow
<br>
<br>
 Hundreds of tiny
<br>
 flying things
<br>
 so small
<br>
 you wouldn’t even notice
<br>
 but for this
<br>
 moment of illumination
<br>
<br>
 Dog’s moan
<br>
 so particular
<br>
 I even know
<br>
 which dog
<br>
<br>
 now, somewhere in the mix
<br>
 a rock dove coos
<br>
<br>
 I know who he was
<br>
 but never really read him
<br>
<br>
 didn’t notice
<br>
 that he’d disappeared
<br>
<br>
 let alone that you’d died
<br>
<br>
 now, 21 years later
<br>
 these brilliant poems
<br>
 shimmer in the light
<br>
 well not the light exactly
<br>
 this gray paper
<br>
 starting to darken with age
<br>
 These beach houses
<br>
 furnished all alike
<br>
 pastels too bright
<br>
 seashell decorations
<br>
 & the promise
<br>
 of an outdoor shower
<br>
<br>
 The “girl” at the market
<br>
 made me happy
<br>
 with her Russian accent
<br>
<br>
 The compost of America
<br>
 becoming that much more rich
<br>
<br>
 The joints of my legs
<br>
 conjoin with the pelvis
<br>
 where just to sit still
<br>
 is not entirely
<br>
 “pain free”
<br>
<br>
 This gigantic notebook
<br>
<br>
 Gradually the poem
<br>
 unveils itself
<br>
 I hear my son yawn
<br>
 two rooms away
<br>
<br>
 The rain appears to have stopped
<br>
<br>
 but that bird’s returned
<br>
 with its 5-note song
<br>
<br>
 Dear Philip,
<br>
 it’s 5:03 AM
<br>
 nine hours west of here
<br>
 three hours west of Hawai’i
<br>
<br>
 I have to be careful now
<br>
 at the sight of the slightest spider
<br>
 It might be you
<br>
<br>
 At dawn
<br>
 one finds moths
<br>
 gathered at the sink
<br>
<br>
 A pickup truck
<br>
 in whose bed stand
<br>
 upright
<br>
 tied tight
<br>
 (bright orange straps)
<br>
 a dozen glass doors
<br>
<br>
 Today’s first jogger
<br>
 heading west along the canal
<br>
<br>
 on a side street the first power walker
<br>
 heading south
<br>
<br>
 Another jogger
<br>
 (the first guy)
<br>
 trotting thru
<br>
 these long shadows
<br>
<br>
 he’s heading north
<br>
<br>
 Nobody yet
<br>
 walking their dog
<br>
 tho I hear one
<br>
 a few doors away
<br>
<br>
 The one we call Psycho Dog
<br>
 loves to hurl himself
<br>
 against the electronic fence
<br>
<br>
 This jogger returns
<br>
 limping
<br>
<br>
 O very pale golden lab
<br>
 nose down
<br>
 checking the odors
<br>
 as it walks
<br>
<br>
 Majestic blue heron
<br>
 threads the sky
<br>
<br>
 Quick enough rain storm
<br>
 but now all the lawn chairs are soaked
<br>
<br>
 Quiet enough
<br>
 I can hear the guy next door
<br>
 talking on the phone
<br>
 “Okay”
<br>
 he says
<br>
 accenting each syllable
<br>
 the second drawn out
<br>
 nearly becomes two
<br>
<br>
 An old cheese stick in the car
<br>
 just as good as ever
<br>
<br>
 What are the lines
<br>
 What are the words
<br>
 I need
<br>
 to make sense
<br>
 of my life?
<br>
<br>
 Oooh, scolds X,
<br>
 he was right there
<br>
 right at the edge
<br>
 about to recognize a feeling
<br>
<br>
 & you!
<br>
 meaning me
<br>
 you had to jump right in
<br>
 you always do that
<br>
<br>
 But it’s not
<br>
 I wanted to say later
<br>
 driving the dark road north
<br>
 it’s not about feeling
<br>
 Y has so many
<br>
 he’s paralyzed by the weight of them
<br>
 it’s about doing
<br>
 he needs to do something
<br>
 Anything at all
<br>
<br>
 Giant yellow telescope
<br>
 at midtown highrise window
<br>
 not for the sky
<br>
 but to glimpse neighbors fucking
<br>
<br>
 The lone skylight
<br>
 was in the second bathroom
<br>
<br>
 A pile of towels
<br>
 where I hope to sit
<br>
<br>
 hop to sit
<br>
<br>
 How to position
<br>
 the cycle of texts
<br>
<br>
 like knowing
<br>
 for each line
<br>
 where to draw
<br>
 the left margin
<br>
<br>
 This howl is my Howl
<br>
 dog’s growl
<br>
 inflected by wagging tail
<br>
<br>
 Hail to the clef
<br>
 Cliff note
<br>
<br>
 Smallest distance between
<br>
 beats of the heart
<br>
<br>
 I saw my mother married
<br>
 only as a toddler
<br>
<br>
 Try to fathom now
<br>
 all the difference
<br>
 that’s made
<br>
<br>
 A tall page
<br>
 to stand for ages
<br>
 Truman is still President
<br>
<br>
 Tho I don’t yet know
<br>
 quite what that means
<br>
<br>
If a fountain pen
<br>
where then is the fountain?
<br>
<br>
The soprano sings
<br>
Come All _Ye Fair & Tender Maidens_
<br>
while the baritone
<br>
with somewhat less flash
<br>
intones _On Top_
<br>
_Of Old Smoky_
<br>
the percussion quartet
<br>
hyperactive but surprisingly quiet
<br>
more space between notes than within
<br>
<br>
What one hears
<br>
decades on
<br>
will differ
<br>
An auditorium filled
<br>
with white hair
<br>
(Who will hear
<br>George Crumb
<br>
once his generation’s gone?)
<br>
<br>
I don’t sculpt Google
<br> nor ogle giggles
<br>
but each letter
<br>
is somehow carved
<br>
from what?
<br>
from who?
<br>
from how
<br>
<br>
From here I look out on a room
<br>
that my children
<br>
might imagine as primal
<br>
as I do that one
<br>
gone so long ago
<br>
<br>
The television in the corner
<br>
to the right of the fireplace
<br>
in front of a case
<br>
filled with books
<br>
<br>
The Big Book
<br>
of Little Stanzas
<br>
<br>
including the one
<br>
I thought last night
<br>
to write
<br>
right here
<br>
<br>
Bowl of frozen meatballs
<br>
microwaved
<br>
for my son’s breakfast
<br>
fills the air
<br>
eau d’ meat
<br>
<br>
The great busyness of dreams
<br>
does not survive
<br>
the violence
<br>
of the electronic toothbrush
<br>
placed in one’s head
<br>
<br>
What was I doing?
<br>
<br>
Am I doing it still?
<br>
<br>
Some threat to the dream
<br>
but vague
<br>
& not immediate
<br>
<br>
So that all I recall
<br>
is the desert climate
<br>
warm but not oppressive
<br>
the sun in great quantity
<br>
<br>
Word order in Turkish
<br>
matters far less
<br>
enabling different forms of play
<br>
<br>
Man bites dog
<br>
well not quite
<br>
<br>
With that much room
<br>
I’d never back out of the driveway
<br>
<br>
The Age of Melted Wax
<br>
<br>
NCIS
<br>
not the agency
<br>
the show is all about
<br>
expectations of privacy
<br>
<br>
Few & far between
<br>
2 hidden assumptions
<br>
the line, the margin
<br>
An old song
<br>
from World War I
<br>
_Over There_
<br>
<br>
By using a notebook, do I become quaint?
<br>
<br>
Magnetized hooks
<br>
on the side of the fridge
<br>
Some Civil War vets
<br>
still were alive
<br>
when I was a child
<br>
<br>
The “paper boy”
<br>
is a middle-aged man
<br>
in a large sedan
<br>
<br>
you could track
<br>
the history
<br>
not just of
<br>
retail capital
<br>
but of technology itself
<br>
through the rise
<br>
& later demise
<br>
of the video store
<br>
<br>
Tasteless “dots”
<br>
marketed as
<br>
The Future of Ice Cream
<br>
<br>
The way the Beats distrusted
<br>
Ferlinghetti’s sense of business
<br>
while sending City Lights their manuscripts
<br>
<br>
Each sentence fills with sorrow
<br>
What if history itself
<br>
should not endure?
<br>
Joe Brainard’s
<br>
_Nancy as an ashtray_
<br>
reflects a curious misogyny
<br>
A bias
<br>
in haiku
<br>
against titles
<br>
<br>
The winter of
<br>
short skirts
<br>
& long boots
<br>
Who reads
<br>
Rod McKuen now?
<br>
I climb the long stairs
<br>
to the floor on which
<br>
in the far rear corner
<br>
they stock poetry
<br>
Outside, from a card table
<br>
an old couple
<br>
sell plates from Iznik
<br>
A young man pops in my face
<br>
to implore
<br>
Will you save a mountain tonight?
<br>
<br>
