I looked in my bank account
<br>
<br>
It said, “you have five toilets to your name.”

It said, “don’t just sit there. Return fire.”
<br>
<br>
Talking head says, “go to sleep children. You will all be police tomorrow.”
<br>
<br>
We say: No. We will be the poor.
<br>
<br>
Talking head says, “ok scumbags, I talked to you like children; now you will be dogs”
<br>
<br>
“Market Street” is the best two-word joke I have ever heard in San Francisco
<br>
<br>
“Now I have to teach myself how to pass out sketches and throw pencils at pigeons when I retire”

“I don’t have any friends who would reprimand me anyway”

 “Retire to the ocean and walk backwards into the surf<br>pretending to fight off the weirdly dressed hordes”
 <br>
 <br>
<div style="text-align:right; font-size:18px;"> -and I used to joke about being underwater.</div>

<br>
Laughed at the people stealing my cigarettes
Laughed at the people pretending to tie my shoes
<br>
<br>
“now I have to put charcoal under the classroom and do impossible things with tap water”
<br>
<br>
“leave the window open so that the most respectful rats will come in and white enlightenment will have something to ponder.”
<br>
<br>
-oh what machines may come
<br>
<br>
“I should have never quit heroin,” we all say (all of the time)
<br>
we started early.
twenty wagons appeared in a dream I had about the 7th grade.
<br>
<br>
Pathology needs a god to represent it to children and child like states
<br>
<br>
_Eat your people today_
<br>
<br>
_The top of the tornado starts under our shoe soles_
_And touches down on prison farms_
_Bibles offer no explanation_
_But one cool preacher has quite a laugh_
<br>
<br>
_All looked up at our beautiful shoes_

<div style="text-align:right; font-size:18px;">
“You still keep that knife in the car.”
<br>
-the reality is
<br>
that I am awake
<br>
and listening to an
<br>
argument outside
<br>
half listening
<br>
half fighting alongside
<br>
-the reality is
<br>
that I am built
<br>
to protect religion,
<br>
but not all of the time
<br>
<br>
</div>

<div style="text-align:center; font-size:18px;">
“I was watching her on my hands”

“even my imagination just sat there”
<br>
<br>
“the entire crowd did not take a sip for twenty minutes”
<br>
<br>
-the choir is done with you

done with all of us
<br>
<br>
</div>
<br>
_“We call those projects ‘The Jar’”_
<br>
_the private said to himself_
<br>
_while working on his birthday_
<br>
<br>
_“backflip and become a man”_
<br>
_we said as we aimed_
<br>
<br>
_“lie down right over there._

_We hid the beds behind the trash”_
<br>
<br>
_-the rest of the crash course came in the morning_
<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:right; font-size:18px;">
“like you’ve never seen this card trick before
<br>
the one where your grandfather appears
<br>
and throws a couple of people into a fire”
<br>
<br>
-just let it rockslide into that shot glass
<br>
<br>

I should have talked to her
<br>
<br>

instead I threw my whole life away
<br>
<br>

I turned my back on my people, Lord
<br>
<br>

left them for a trip up three flights of stairs
<br>
<br>

now the whole freak show is on the back of my hand
<br>
<br>

including capitalists looking up at the sky
<br>
<br>
</div>
_what fascists are determined to do_
<br>
_does not scare most people_
<br>
<br>
_it makes most people bored,_
<br>
_but we want our grandparents to survive…_
<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center; font-size:18px;">
Dear grandfather,
<br>
<br>
I met some bluesmen today.
<br>
Vanquished them all.
<br>
I declared, “your lady is with you,
<br>
but all these chairs in here
<br>
are mine.”
<br>
<br>
</div>
Before I opened the door to the street
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knocked
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the world let me in
<br>
<br>
Stumbled outside
<br>
And there were miles and miles
<br>
Of chalk outlines and window curtains
<br>
littered across the earth’s city
<br>

<div style="text-align:right; font-size:18px;">
Dear Bluesmen,
<br>
Now I am deader than you.
<br>
Please take your seats.
<br>
-the title of our song
<br>
