>I’m telling you that microbes have been reinvented in order to impose a new idea of god.
–Antonin Artaud

<br>
<br>
<br>
If at first we could not be distinguished from the objects of our perception, and if later our objects came to perceive us better than we them, the only thing left to do was to become imperceptible. Our first inspiration, the siberian actinobacteria, is the oldest known continuously living organism on Earth. It does DNA repair below freezing, indicating it’s been alive, not dormant, in the permafrost for a half-million years. Half-million years of imperceptible life.
<br>
<br>
The collective took seriously the etymology of culture. Certain microbes practice consensus, and while they may not have what you call a civic life, without them no civic life as such would exist. As had so many visionaries before us, we recognized that *we ourselves* (obvious, all too obvious) would not live to see the utopia of the microbes, microorganisms, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and certain worms. Viruses, digital data, memories, particles, ideas, concepts, dreams, organisms that live on electricity, artists so unknown they suspect they are already dead, the half-thought, aleatory and gestural, and ghosts, would thrive. There in the exhale-thin space where the distinction between work and whatever is not work, between entertainment and labor, had eroded, in that space just before upgrades replaced forms, before research replaced concerns, any species or thing that already was, or had the capacity to be imperceptible could find a place in this no-place between dissolving brackets: extremely old rocks at the center of the earth, certain clouds at night early in the life of the planet, utterly ignored loners, the obscure surmises of children known to say things like, “When we’re dead we’ll be able to see what is a dinosaur.”
<br>
<br>
Evolutionary principles in The Imperceptible Utopia would differ radically from the normative bio- metaphysics of “natural selection.” There would no longer be anything perceptible to coopt, destroy, then save, coopt, destroy, then save, coopt, destroy, then save.
<br>
<br>
But in the end, our dream of participation was grandiose. The Imperceptible Utopia had no need of us, none whatsoever. Retroactively, our collective could only be described as half-measured and chimerical. It was not stupid enough to put a car in space, but not smart enough to break news gently. It had the belt but not the patience of a carpenter. It had the quickness but not the commitment of a hummingbird. It had float but lacked reflexivity. It had camouflage but lacked enemies. It had the dream-life of an A.I. and startlingly hot feet of a shoeless tarmac walker in summer in Nevada. It had the purposefulness but not the recall of a pragmatist. It had the fathomless, awe-striking rarity of an unexpectedly ancient jawbone but not the wherewithal to be found. It had falcon eyes, and sloped-racetrack-of-ice slickness, but no real desire to talk.
<br>
<br>
And so we scattered to the domesticated winds.
