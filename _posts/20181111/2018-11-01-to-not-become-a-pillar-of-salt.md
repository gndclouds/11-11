<br><br>
I don’t particularly go in for telling stories, I like to forget things, I forget things on purpose, but if you held a gun to my head and told me that you’d kill me if I didn’t tell you a story–I know what story I would tell you. It’s something that happened to me when I was twenty--four years old that I entirely forgot about (I told you I forget about things on purpose) until yesterday.
<br><br>
I had moved to a small island, population 410. I worked for a small company. The directors made me nervous, but I assumed it was just the natural nervousness of a new job and that it would fade with time. It never did. I never got over the feeling of intimidation I felt around them.
<br><br>
But I learned to act very natural at work. The first day, they gave me what turned out to be my only assignment. “Please, make a spreadsheet of all sources of private funding available from organizations which contained the following code somewhere in their documentation at some point over the past three decades: IjkeRt5671_410.” This arcane task became my whole job. It was hard for me to tell what the funds were for as I dutifully logged the data. The language of the documents they had me searching was nominally English, but beyond my ken. “Specialized.”
<br><br>

I was on the outer circle of the outer circle, a paid gleaner of obscure documents and an occasional proofreader for banal white papers that contained no discernible substance. But I’m ashamed to say I didn’t care: I was indifferent to what they were doing. Vague, embarrassing, and unfulfilled longings for sex and revelation preoccupied me, dampening the faculty of curiosity. I put in my eight hours and I went home.
<br><br>
My employers worked constantly, every day and night, but they didn’t expect me to. I took weekends for myself, though I never left the island. They left me alone on my days off, never calling or intruding on my nights or weekends. As a result, when, about six months into working for them, I saw their number on my phone in the middle of the day on a Saturday, I thought they must have an important reason to call.
<br><br>
I had been at the beach looking at the ocean, not really thinking about anything or doing anything important, just sort of enjoying my raw surroundings and pondering the idea of swimming for the first time since I had moved to the island for the job earlier that year.
<br><br>
My days were stultifying, spent at a desk. I was an assembly line information worker, unable to interpret what I was doing in any meaningful way, even if I _had_ cared to (I had given analysis one or two half--hearted tries). I had begun to exist in a perpetual, cobwebbed haze. I had no motivation to do anything creative during my time off and often spent the weekends in a broody stupor, napping, watching movies, staring at the ocean, and reading magazines. But after all, I had aspirations, and it was clear I couldn’t wake myself up on my own. It occurred to me that a plunge into the ocean might be salutary. I had confined myself to admiring the ocean from afar until then, avoided getting to know it on the inside. But on that day, I felt I needed an ordeal. One difficult, delightful, naked and cold--as--fuck slip down, and I’d emerge all new and erased, an elemental reboot. I’d get in and then right back out, cleaving to the shore–I’m not much of a swimmer, to say the least, and the North Atlantic is rough, cold, and full of jellyfish. I was after a wake up, not a negative shock. (And by negative shock, you know what I mean. Even a baby knows what I mean.)
<br><br>
I had just determined in my mind to get into the water, but had not yet moved, when my phone rang. I answered. It was R., my supervisor. Without any preamble she said, “Please, don’t go swimming.”
<br><br>
I had never heard her *say please* before. I told myself to respond but I was at a loss.
<br><br>
And then I suddenly realized that since I had not responded, had barely even breathed since first answering the phone, I could pretend that I hadn’t heard her, act like the reception had cut out. I could give a fake response to her fake request. I told my shaking self that that I had a right to–it was the weekend. I felt an imperative to restore normalcy by pretending that this phone call had not happened, as much to myself as to her. Whatever it meant that my employer knew I had intended to go swimming at that moment, even though I was alone and had only _thought_ about it, I did not want to know. And whatever it meant that she was invading my privacy and instructing me _not_ to, I was even less inclined to know.<nobr> I warbled, “. . . the reception</nobr> is bad here, <nobr>I can’t hear you . . . are you there?”</nobr>
<br><br>
Possibly it was obvious to R. that I was lying, but that didn’t matter to me. Her call had released me from the obligation to respect reality. I hung up, turned off the phone, and flung it away from me. I ran to the flat where I had been living, and, with a note of regret, which chimed briefly in the cathedral of my relief, I hurriedly packed my few things and caught the next ferry off the island and erased the whole episode from my mind.
