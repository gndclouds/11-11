Christopher Merrill has published six collections of poetry, including _Watch Fire_, for which he received the Lavan Younger Poets Award from the Academy of American Poets; many edited volumes and translations; and six books of nonfiction, among them, _Only the Nails Remain: Scenes from the Balkan Wars_, _Things of the Hidden God_: _Journey to the Holy Mountain_, _The Tree of the Doves: Ceremony_, _Expedition_, _War_, and _Self-Portrait with Dogwood_. His writings have been translated into nearly forty languages; his journalism appears widely; his honors include a Chevalier from the French government in the Order of Arts and Letters. As director of the International Writing Program at the University of Iowa, Merrill has conducted cultural diplomacy missions to more than fifty countries. He serves on the U.S. National Commission for UNESCO, and in April 2012 President Obama appointed him to the National Council on the Humanities.

What am I thinking about? I'm thinking about the lecture I will give to twenty Russian professors here at Yasnaya Polyana, Tolstoy’s country estate, some details of which I worked out on a long walk in the fields and woods that inspired _War and Peace_ and _Anna Karenina_, and then I will turn my attention to the shape of my next book, _The Trials of Roger Williams_, a biography of my first ancestor in the New World. Which is to say: I’m at once excited and quite anxious.
