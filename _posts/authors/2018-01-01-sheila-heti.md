Sheila Heti is the author of eight books, including the novels _Motherhood_ and _How Should a Person Be_? Her books have been translated into more than a dozen languages. She lives in Toronto. She is currently thinking about art criticism, theology, and that again she has scheduled too much into her week, and yet she has nothing to do.
