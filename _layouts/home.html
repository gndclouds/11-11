      <p style="font-size:24px;">The journal <i>11.11</i> re-emerges into the world after a one-year hiatus.<br> The year of thinking about reading and writing, about ecologies and<br>reading ecologies, brings us to this day, 11.11.18 when the magazine<br> once again shows its face to The World. The intention of our editorial<br> team is to offer readers a chance to read, online, “cover to cover” and<br> to have that great feeling of having read “cover to cover.” Over the<br> next months, as we push towards our second issue, designed around<br> ideas of Ecopoesis, we will continue to explore what it means to read<br> on the screen. As I write this, people continue to talk about whether<br> our faces are too enmeshed with screens. The goal of this magazine<br> is to make each second of that joining of brain to code a deliberate<br> act. And a beautiful one.<br>Talk to me.<br>Leslie Carol Roberts, Editorial Director<br>Lroberts2@cca.edu<br>
