        <p>In 2017, the journal suspended publication for one year while the mission and design were reimagined.
          The reimagined journal went live on 11.11.18 as a journal of art, design, literature, culture, civil society, democracy, climate change, politics, among others â€“ that is, all the things artists, designers and writers ponder and make work
          towards.</p>

        <p>The title was shifted to the numeric spelling, 11.11, and poems and essays and stories and interviews are joined now by discussions and debates around ecologies and ecopoetics; design and urbanism; architecture and the built environment;
          and the role of the arts in vibrant urban communities. </p>
