<p style="font-family:'Fabrik',san-serif;font-size: 24px;line-height:1.8em;text-align:left; color:#000000;">And You May Find Yourself at the End of a Decade and in a New Epoch</p>

<p style="font-family:'Fabrik',san-serif;font-size: 18px;line-height:1.8em;text-align:left; color:#000000;">Why would a literary magazine swerve towards the environmental humanities, devoting an entire issue to ideas of ecologies, environmental design,  architectural interventions to rising waters, and the social-acitivist-art-making-language-pondering Ecopoesis </p>

<br />

<p>
Under one of our impossibly blue San Francisco skies in 2018, two architects and a writer began re-imagining stories, forms, and messaging about the entire Earth, humans and nonhumans, seas and glaciers, mythos and facts. We felt an obligation to create a communal journey that would resist the stories of destruction, decay, and demise, lapping at our toes each morning. So Ecopoesis was born here, birthed as a community that gathers to rethink what we say and do when we communicate about climate catastrophe. It felt, increasingly, like we were facing, with growing fear, a pre-loaded collective hallucination called apocalypse, biosphere collapse, and annihilation. Each day seemed to serve up another fact of melting, rising, and death of current ecological realities. What if we, as humans, took our lead instead from the idea that if we can build these flawed and cruel systems, the hypercapitalism, the misogyny, the racism, the speciesism, then we canand we rebuild a more equitable world? And so we decided to do nothing less than redirect thought. 
</p>
<br />
<p>
And so we began. We built a town square of sorts, named it Ecopoesis, and situated it at the intersection of art, architecture, design, technology, literature, and philosophy. The central idea was to explore how we can imaginatively and tactically re-design both our shared stories and our shared systems -- economic, ecological, political, legal, and social. We created a word cloud of terms that begin with “re-” and sent out invitations to four dozen friends and associates across diverse disciplines and thinking frames -- from nonprofits to universities to industry to government agencies -- and asked them to join us to think together about ecologies. What if we pause and take time to share how we feel about our shifting ecologies? As artists and writers and designers, we felt utterly compelled towards making work at this gathering. So we created a methodology that we call embodied messaging. Ecopoesis in this form is a cauldron for interrogating concepts: Do we remain, resist, retreat? Do we revise, recreate, recede? Perhaps the most compelling driver for Ecopoesis is that we will need to forget in order to remember. We need each other, humans and nonhumans, with a beautiful passion that needs to be re-ignited, re-surfaced, resurrected. Redesigning the future in the present, through rewriting our stories and remembering what we have been forced to forget: This is the Ecopoesis Movement.
</p>
<br />
<p>
In this issue, we gather with Youmna Chlala and Gayle Romasanta, the two founders of11-11, who created this robust journal while MFA writing students at California College of the Arts.
We also look at the Buoyant Ecologies project, recasting ideas of a floating future. What better way to think about rising and surging waters than one populated by floating communes of humans and non-humans? Our photo essay shares the design and execution of this marvelous idea. 
</p>
<br />
<p>
In addition, we have words by the poet Oliver Baez Bendorf and fiction writer Rita Bullwinkel.
</p>
<br />
<p> 
The first Ecopoesis gathering also benefited from the generosity of the ecological philosopher Timothy Morton, who joined us for two days and shared so much of himself with our small gathering. As the day of making work and words wound up, Tim gave a deeply moving talk, Fullness of Being. We present his words in their entirety here. 
Historically, 11-11, has taken the form of the traditional literary journal. Times change. What is the role of a journal from a diverse art and design and writing community in times of planetary change? It is incumbent upon us as writers, architects, thinkers, artists, and designers to lead in these times, to think about what narratives will drive the revision and remodeling of life on Earth. As writers and artists, as the dreamers and the storymakers, we have long held a particular power to summon stories from our grandmothers, to summon dragons. As Ursula Le Guin wrote, “People who deny dragons are often eaten by dragons. From within.”

I am grateful to my colleagues, Adam Marcus and Chris Falliers, co-founders of the Ecopoesis Movement, as well as to the editorial team of Hannah Lamb-Vines, Ryan Legaspi, and John Kim, for collaborating on this edition.
