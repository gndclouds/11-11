This image of her peeing
<br />
Into the many open mouths
<br />
Of her auditors is a painting
<br />
On black velvet the souvenir
<br />
Of a long ago honeymoon
<br />
“Across the border” the runs
<br />
A serape and a tiny bright tableau
<br />
Of musical skeleton lined up
<br />
As if applying for work
<br />
Or hoping to be paid as if
<br />
Anxiety in the afterlife is
<br />
Cheery bag of bloody-
<br />
Looking dried mango dusted
<br />
With chili and this large
<br />
Artwork in which the arc
<br />
Of that gold liquid goes up
<br />
To come down on (like
<br />
A cow pissing on a flat
<br />
Cliché) the glitter-flecked
<br />
Wet ruby red lips open
<br />
(these gaping spectators)
<br />
Like so many zeros after
<br />
A number the number
<br />
Becomes meaningless
<br />
As the title <em>Deficit</em>
<br />
Comercial with an upside
<br />
Down exclamation
<br />
Mark it was a “bargain”
<br />
Of course I meant
<br />
At the beginning
<br />
To say <em>peering</em>
<br />
<em>Mira</em> a miracle it all
<br />
Seems so cheap
