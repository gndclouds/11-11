<meta name="description" content="Public lecture delivered April, 2019, to culminate the first ECOPOESIS gathering at California College of the Arts, San Francisco “The idea that alienation is being cut off from the future, the possibility that things might be different, has become very easy to think, and very good to think. All this has some consequences for art.” “Most ecological and plenty of non-ecological theories of alienation exist. Most of them state that we are alienated from a past where things were better, or perfect. But this is just the notion of the Fall, translated into some other mode, and that narrative is one way in which agricultural societies talk about the damage they have already done. The inherent speciesism (“nature” versus human culture) of this model is historically bankrolled by racism and patriarchy. There’s another way of thinking about alienation, logically, and luckily there are ways of showing that it’s true: if we aren’t alienated from the past we are alienated from the future. The media tell us that we are approaching the end of the world, because of global warming, but it’s much more serious than that. We are approaching us being dead and children now growing up and having to live in this biosphere, for a long time—longer than the end of time, in any case. The idea that alienation is being cut off from the future, the possibility that things might be different, has become very easy to think, and very good to think. All this has some consequences for art. What happens to a dream deferred? Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun? Or fester like a sore— And then run? Does it stink like rotten meat? Or crust and sugar over— like a syrupy sweet? Maybe it just sags like a heavy load. Or does it explode? This is a poem called “Harlem” and it’s by Langston Hughes. Let’s start to read it. Okay, well who wrote this poem? Langston Hughes would be the easiest answer. But all kinds of author functions, as Foucault used to say, exist. Maybe it’s better to say “Who or what wrote the poem?” It’s quite common for example to reduce Marxist criticism to its vulgar version, where you square the poem with the economic conditions of the day, say about a decade, in the country in which it was written. That Tennyson poem is a typical product of 1840s industrial capitalism in Britain. This Hughes poem is a typical product of 1950s American capitalism. Or whatever. So who wrote the poem? A human being? The human being’s family or psychic issues? The human being’s unconscious? The culture the human lived in? How many do we include? Who wrote the poem? Capitalism? The human genome? The biosphere? The ecosystem around the human poet? A light fall of rain one morning? The climate? The nuclear industry? The military industrial complex? The structure of racism in mid-twentieth century America? The struggle of African Americans to achieve basic rights? You see the thing is, ecological awareness is all about beginning to realize that things are happening on all kinds of scales, all at once, and that these scales aren’t like how you encounter them in museums or online. You can’t toggle nicely and smoothly back and forth from the very small to the very large, from the micro to the macro. That micro macro talk is Neoplatonic medieval something or other anyway. All right, let’s try something else. When was the poem written? The early twentieth century? The week Hughes put pen to paper? The month? One year in his life? The time of modernity? The time of modernism? The time of post-Neolithic civilization? The time of humans on Earth? In a way the poem was written in all of these times. Right? Just like in a way, all the beings I listed earlier wrote the poem. Let’s think about another aspect of the poem. Let’s think about the physical media of which it’s composed. Paper, typewriter ink; pixels, glass screens; microfilm. Roman Jakobson has a clunky but interesting six-part model of communication, that is useful in the way that all structuralist interpretative devices are useful, which is the way in which magic mixers that can slice and dice your food five different ways are useful. Put the poem through the blender, you learn something from what the blender does to it. So the first thing you notice is, there are these spacious gaps between some of the lines, while some other lines are close together. The first line, “What happens to a dream deferred?” has a lot of space around it—it’s trying to make you think, but it’s also trying to make you feel something, the opaque weight of all that deferment. It’s a tight little poem, whose lines have two or three rhythmical feet, and that means that unlike a wall of words, the space around the poem and between the stanzas is highlighted and becomes part of how you read it—you have to find some way to pronounce the blankness at the end of each line. In a way the poem a little bit lonely, like discarded little carton of orange juice that you find one day lying in an empty parking lot—not enough people are noticing what it’s saying. Or, conversely, the poem is trapped in a bath of blankness, pressing in on all sides—if you think about the parking lot the same way, it’s the same thing. something huge and constructed and blank yet weirdly invisible because it’s so hard to see presses in on our powers of thought and our physical powers on all sides. Your feet ache and you feel lonely and you regret the absence of butterflies. (The poem isn’t going to tell you. Poems let themselves be opaque altogether, like that parking lot, or we let them, or both. That means that poems are a place where what I like to call the future future gathers—the radical freshness that enables the possibility that things might be different, rather than the one we can build out from where we are now, using prediction and extrapolation. Again, my point is that we are alienated from the future, not from the past. we aren’t trying to recover an Edenic meaning that the poet somehow hid in there like a message in a bottle. We’re trying to assess the scope and awesomeness of this particular futural gateway.) The weight of deferment—the weight of waiting, as a matter of fact—is legible in the way the poem organizes the medium in which it has been inscribed—the so called “space” is actually the obtruding presence of the physical medium in which the poem exists. Say it’s on paper, well in that case, there’s a lot of pulp, trees, water, sunlight, all the things that make trees that make paper, in that pause. It’s not nothing. It’s not silence, as John Cage would have said—silence is just the way socially determined sounds taper off and you get to hear something else. It’s something I love about the Laser Interferometry Gravitational Observatory, about two miles north west of New Orleans, which is sort of Houston’s sister city. Two laser beams at right angles. It’s a very simple and relatively cheap experiment, compared at any rate with CERN. It’s tens of millions rather than billions, and there’s a difference, although it may seem absurdly expensive to us. At LIGO, these two lasers are bouncing off carefully calibrated mirrors. They pick up everything. Everything. Like cattle walking over the cattle grid in the field outside. People having arguments in an adjoining room about the experiment. Cars going past on the road outside. And you know what’s most uncanny is, if you know the waveforms for these things, you can subtract them from the waveform that results from the vibrating lasers. The movement of tectonic plates; the sound of aircraft…the lasers pick up everything, and when you cut out those cows walking over the grid and so on (I love the cows part), and there’s a tiny squiggle of something left, that you can’t explain, and it has the right sort of anticipated shape, do you know what is? That thing is a gravity wave. It’s a signature of two black holes colliding, one thousand light years away, a tiny flicker of spacetime in which everything on Earth got a little bit smaller and a little bit slower-living, then a little bit bigger and a little bit faster, then back to normal. Half an hour after the new improved LIGO was switched on, with more carefully calibrated lasers, two black holes collided and the energy equaled the output of the entire universe. And a ripple in spacetime spread out until it passed through everything on Earth. Is it not uncanny—rather like the idea of shadowtime that I was hearing about yesterday evening—that the gravity wave was right there, inside the waveform determined by moocows, cars, people arguing, tectonic plates… Does [the dream deferred] stink like rotten meat? Or crust and sugar over— like a syrupy sweet? Maybe it just sags like a heavy load. Or does it explode? Then you realize that the shadowtime is also in the imagery. The rotting of meat—the way it becomes inedible for humans because it’s being eaten by bacteria—the rotting is commensurate, in a metaphorical sense, with the deferment of the dream of un-alienated fullness of being, the “dream” that Hughes is talking about. It’s an ecological process—the appropriation of something we thought was just for us (it’s called “meat” not “cows” or “pigs” for this reason), by something else. The something else-ness is what makes the rottenness of the meat disgusting. That’s a thing that can happen in a few days in your kitchen; the racism is a thing that can happen for several hundred years in the hemisphere you live in on Earth. Metaphor is bringing these two timescales close without collapsing them into one another. “This is that,” in the realm of metaphor rather than math, means also that “this is not that.” Rotting time is not the same as dream deferment time. Then there’s the “crust”-ing and the “sugar”-ing over. Perhaps Hughes means that the dream becomes a candified, plastic, purely aesthetic version of itself, easy to understand but impossible to act out, because it’s been reduced to a commodified consumer object. Given the long history of slavery and sugar, this is a potent image indeed. The Romantic poets Coleridge and Southey argued for boycotting sugar in the mid 1790s, arguing that sugar was an extreme metaphor or catachresis: sugar is the crystallized blood of slaves. The implication in the image is that the sugar coating would be a symptom of continuing slavery. If sugar is alienated slave labor, a sugar-coated dream is an alienated one that you can’t realize, only appreciate. The sick part of the sugaring is that the dream might do it to itself, like how chocolate starts to separate and the ingredients rise and sink, something we call chocolate bloom. The sweetness of the dream might rise to the surface, encrust it and make it impossible to live it. The oppressive forces are installed inside of the dream, because the dream is in relation to them, and is born within them. And in an ecological context, if, as I believe, destroying racism would be tantamount to undoing a gigantic amount of the ideologies that sever us from other lifeforms, a severing actively and automatically pursued for thousands of years in what is called civilization, the response to the mid global warming of the Holocene—if destroying racism means that, then “Harlem” is talking obliquely about an ecological politics. Let’s talk about that for a moment—what I mean by that. Economics isn’t about dollars and interest rates. Dollars and interest rates aren’t about dollars and interest rates. All that stuff is reified capitalist theology, aka economics 101 in non-communist universities. Economics is how you organize your enjoyment, how you organize how stuff flows around in your house, your home, your world, all the shit that you have going on. And ecology is how the house, the home, the world that you’ve got going works, the logic of it. Economics and ecology are intertwined, etymologically, logically, socially, everything. So the question is, do these things pertain only to human beings? Do you have cockroaches and rats in or around your home? Do you look after a cat, and is it your house the cat lives in? Since I leave the house a lot more than the cat, in many ways it’s the cat’s house more than mine. This is sort of related to how, when I became a dad, I had that this is not my beautiful house feeling, very quickly, as Claire began to make it very clear that it was her house, not mine—psychologically that’s very true, isn’t it, your parents’ house that you grew up in was much more yours than theirs, it was the first world you lived in. They just happened to rent or buy or whatever another living space in a series. And related to this question, another question of pleasure. If we don’t like the theology of dollars and structural unemployment and having to work to live and all that stuff—if we think we are a bit socialist or Marxist or anarcho-communist whatever—do we think it would be a good idea to include cockroaches and cats in the revolutionary projects we have going on to transmogrify our homes, our worlds, into things that are more pleasurable for the beings who have stuff going on, like trying to find out where the rats really live in my cat’s case, or trying to write a lecture when you’re feeling really depressed about ecological politics and mass extinction in my case, etc? From a utilitarian point of view—which I find deeply problematic but whatever let’s use it, because it’s pretty default in our world—just existing is a form of pleasure. So if there are more revolutionary beings, like hedgehogs with little Che Guevara caps and stuff, that means more pleasure, so involving more lifeforms in revolutionary struggles would be better. Thanks very much for listening, my name is Tim Morton and if you have any questions I’ll be available afterwards. Right. So let’s go back to the poem. There’s the stuff about the dream rotting or glazing itself with sugar. I like very much how the dream immediately is a physical thing, something lying around in the sun. Then there’s another gap, and the idea that the dream might just continue, in an abject sort of way, “sagging” “Like a heavy load”—the dream itself has lost its utopian dreamlike lightness and has itself become one of the things that hangs over your head. In writing this poem, the authors (for Langston Hughes is one of them, but there are many that his work brings into alignment) seem to be observing that a whole complex range of timescales and histories are felt in the deferment of the dream, whose lingering potency is present in its absence in the way the poem organizes the blank space around it. But the blank space isn’t blank. The poem obviously plays with topics such as rotting and producing sugars, or being coated by sugars, processes that are to do with the biochemistry of lifeforms in a biosphere. The gaps in the poem mean that something there, but what is there? The open question quality is legible in the opacity of those gaps. What is there quite literally is the paper or the pixels, and what is there definitely and more figuratively is the labor of black people—what Karl Marx would call the species being of humans. Marx identifies this with imaginative projection and appropriation, but we don’t have to. Let’s just focus on the brute, aka silent, presence of physical being in those gaps, a physical being whose analog are the concrete images of rotting, sugaring and exploding. What is this physical being? The work of slaves, thought in typical western philosophy as a machinic functioning, like the behavior of an algorithm. Slavery articulates the anthropocentric differences between humans and so-called animals: humans, like slave owners, act, while animals, like slaves, merely behave. You can see immediately that the ways we have of talking about this stuff are deeply contaminated by speciesism, and that this has to do with racism, and I’m going to try to sort out exactly how in this talk. Because blank space isn’t just blank, and because the physical medium the poem appears in doesn’t just function smoothly in the background. That’s the whole point—the obtrusion of the paper or pixels into the poem itself is a kind of malfunction, like rotting or sugaring or sagging, and perhaps like exploding: that’s the question the poem poses altogether—is the exploding an error? We know it’s the logical consequence, within the poem, of continuing oppression. But does “explode” mean “explode into life and therefore become dangerous to the white powers that be” or does “explode” mean “evaporate as if it had never existed at all”? The blank space is and isn’t the poem. It’s a place where the poem malfunctions or rather, a place where the poem reveals that one being’s functioning is another being’s malfunction, and more deeply, how lines of poetry and spaces between them and everything else are all a series of malfunctions, such that smoothness is an illusion. Indeed, the deferment and the supposed silence are symptoms of a massive malfunction, in the fully “evil” sense of “mal” as the first syllables of that word. An evil functioning is what is detected in the gaps in the poem, the persistence of a state that has indeed been naturalized—the relations between white and black people—but which is anything but natural; or rather, the smoothness of its supposed naturalness is in fact a symptom of horrific violence, like the peaceful atmosphere after a tornado or bomb test. And isn’t that ecological awareness in a nutshell, really? The fact that since there is always an environment—some kind of opacity, some kind of surrounding something in which things are taking place—that the silence and absence isn’t to do with the reader being stupid or evil. Environmental awareness isn’t about being smarter or wiser than the average person. It’s just how awareness in general is, that it always takes place against some kind of taken for granted structure or background or set of assumptions or rows of beehives or vineyards or sugar plantations…there’s always a shadow side, always a shadowtime—it’s not that if you’re truly ecological there are no shadows. It’s that there are more. You are more haunted than you were. Ecological awareness most certainly is not about seeing things more clearly than Joe Public. Ecological awareness is about being willing to be haunted. We’ll see quite soon just how hard wired into ecology are concepts of specters, ghosts, shadows, fleeting things that appear in the corner of your eye. Ecologica awareness doesn’t mean you exorcised the bad artificial stuff and got back to nature. It mean that a greater number than ever of opaque semi-silent shadowy beings are making soft noises in the margins...it’s something that is powerfully conveyed in Amiri Baraka’s “Something in the Way of Things,” a poem whose paranoid tone aims to delineate the spooky, spectral presence of brutality and exploitation and racism in the fabric of the seemingly quiet street along which the narrator is walking. Paranoia is the default, ground state version of empathy—the more paranoid I am about you, are you really a robot or not, is the way I become more and more interested in you as a person. This whole idea that people are beings who obviously act and animals are beings who obviously behave, like robots, is theological and extreme, and, as I’m already starting to argue if you can feel it, racist. Ecological awareness is not about making other people feel stupid. It’s about realizing that because there’s at least one shadowy corner around which you’re not seeing, you yourself are always stupid. The shadows are infinite because we don’t know in advance how many there are, not because they go on forever. It’s all shadows. The dreams of dead people, waiting to be fulfilled by the living. All the entities that the poem gathers—African American humans, white people, cows and sheep and paper and pixels, all these beings coexist in ways that overlap. You could say for example that the human species is a heap of things such as humans and cows and computers and ideas about knitting and feudal monarchy and sand. And beaches are a heap of things such as sand and humans and waves and seaweed and so on. If you think of the world in terms of hyperobjects you are thinking of the world in terms of lots of gigantic overlapping things that are finite and fuzzy. Who wrote the poem is a heap of inconsistent things. When the poem was written is a heap of inconsistent times. And if you like ecological beings such as meadows and beaches and nice city streets with people being decent together, you had better believe in heaps. Logic, traditional vanilla Western logic that is, makes it almost impossible to believe in heaps. You can take bits out of a heap while still calling it a heap, until there’s nothing left, whereupon you realize that there must be no such things as heaps because look, here’s a whole lot of nothing and you were assuming there was a heap right up to that point. It’s called the Sorites paradox. Clouds, according to this, don’t really exist, because they’re made of little bits of cloud stuff; when you subtract the cloud stuff you get smaller and smaller bits of cloud stuff until there’s nothing—so there are no clouds, because clouds are vague. In the same way, you can argue that the Amazon jungle is just a gigantic feedlot waiting to happen, because if you take trees away there’s still a jungle, and you can keep on going till there’s just one tree, so jungles don’t really exist. But perhaps being vague is a criterion for existing. It certainly doesn’t seem easy to get rid of vague and downright contradictory things, without tying yourself in knots. Furthermore, you have to be a holist of some kind to be ecological. The trouble is, most forms of holism are exclusive and explosive. What do I mean? I mean that maybe we need to think that wholes are vague and messy and contradictory, not like Pan Man beings that eat up their contents and digest them totally. A cow could be part of one hyperobject—the human species thought in a non-essentialist way—and part of another one—the cow species for example, which in an expanded way also includes grass. The last time western philosophy tried to talk about all of whatever we are at once it got it very wrong and said “white man” all the time, like scratch the surface of any human and you’ll find a white man underneath. But humans caused global warming, not dolphins. We had better have an idea of who we are that is real and up to date and not racist or patriarchal. Thinking of ourselves as part of a vague heap of things that aren’t all to do with us exclusively, whoever we think we are, is a good place to start. There really are wholes, but they’re not your grandaddy’s whole, all perfect and fully integrated. Otherwise the whole called human is a totally different world from the world called moocows, and so we might get to thinking that we can do what we want with moocows or just totally ignore them. If we can’t overlap, we can’t communicate. If the concept of word means something self-contained and rigid, there’s no hope at all. And someone can say “My concept of world is much richer than yours, or you don’t have one at all, so I own Australia now.” I reckon this vacuum sealed world concept comes from rigid class hierarchies and I reckon that comes from demarcating the difference between human and nonhuman space using things like walls, because you have created granaries to preserve food from the ravages of mild global warming. You sealed off your human survival temporality, so you justify this by getting to think in various ways that the seal demarcates something real (religion, tragedy, philosophy, however you do it). It’s about 10 000 BCE, and you’re doing the right thing, at your scale, just like how starting your car in the morning doesn’t cause global warming. No, it really doesn’t. you’re not guilty. Besides, eating a bit less meat is much, much more effective than buying a Tesla, and easier too. You justify the demarcations and divisions of labor by explaining that the other classes must be different, really, really different beings altogether. And this is how racism begins to function. And it’s that internal human division that enables speciesism, the imagined difference between humans and everyone else. Think of that great diagram in robotics design, the Uncanny Valley. It explains racism while being racist in itself, so it’s very good to analyze, so we can come up with something else. On one side of the valley is a very suspicious being, the so-called “healthy human being,” and I think we can all hear the normal vs pathological, eugenics resonance in that concept. Exactly what is that, I don’t wonder for more than a second, speaking as we are close to Sacramento where in the early twentieth century horrible eugenics experiments were carried out, such as leaving newborn babies to die in hospital because they were unfit. On the other side of the valley is a cute so-called animal, or their electornic equivalent, the cute droid such as R2D2. They’re cute because they’re different—they’re separated by a thin hard line, which is what the Uncanny Valley looks like when you look across it at R2D2, because of foreshortening. Hitler was fond of his dog Blondi because Blondi was different enough from him, so that he could feel all those nice sublimated cute aggression feelings and make animal rights legislation. Let’s just face it—a lot of environmental organizations have had deep connections with white supremacy, and I’m explaining why. The Uncanny Valley diagram was created because it became well known in robotics that as you came closer and closer to imitating a lifelike human being, the robot passed through a phase that appeared strange or scary or creepy. The ultimate nadir of the Uncanny Valley is the zombie, the animated corpse who is a parody of the Cartesian self, just a body animated by some invisible force, moving in an automated way like the brooms in the Sorcerer’s Apprentice. According to hicks I overheard in rural Colorado (!), the zombie apocalypse is a pretty obviously racist concept about hordes of nonwhite people coming for your property, Barbara, and what’s awesome about many zombie works of art is how they subvert that. Anyway, the nice cute difference between me and R2D2 or Blondi the Alsatian is enabled by all the beings labeled as inhuman, subhuman and so on, beings that racism has chucked into the Uncanny Valley. Speciesism—the rigid difference between a human and a nonhuman—is enabled by racism—the machinery that categorizes some beings as inhuman or subhuman. Until you find out that you are in fact Neanderthals in some way, you tell yourself that they are uncanny failed versions of humans who just behaved like zombies, unlike us who have imagination and can see round corners and figure out how to make the zombies go extinct by slaughtering them all. So the way out of the Valley is actually not to get rid of the uncanny, which would make everything into a cute little machine coexisting in some fascist medium, we are all Earthlings or whatever, but actually the way out is to jump into the Valley, to realize that we ourselves are uncanny beings, that being a lifeform at all is being uncanny, because you are strangely strange all the way down. Because you are a symbiotic product of a truly random series of mutations called evolution. Which means that there is no Valley, because there is no healthy human being or perfect cute R2D2. Ecological awareness is like realizing you are on a gigantic flat plain on which exist all kinds of hazy weird beings whose status as alive or not alive, sentient or not sentient, conscious or not conscious (and even existing or not-existing) is not settled, but disturbed at every point. Again, ecological awareness doesn’t mean you stuck your head in a tree and forgot all your problems. It means you allowed yourself to be more haunted than ever, and in particular, that founding religious difference between act and behave that gives you humans versus everything else, imagination versus computing, let there be light versus being a slave, and all that toxic stuff, that act/behave boundary is not erased so that everything is a machine (which means there is still a perfume of act versus behave going on somewhere), but that everything is profoundly ambiguous. You can’t tell whether I am an android or not, and that’s what makes you treat me like a person. You don’t have to prove that rocks are definitely alive, you just have to notice that “alive” or “conscious” means I’m paranoid that you might be a zombie. Coexisting in symbiosis means you might have swallowed poison, and you did—it’s called being alive, which kills you in the end. There was no true difference between you and the cats and the vultures. The difference was enabled by difference between yourself and other humans. So what is the basic tone of a reality in which being haunted is the basic background to everything? This is the same as the reality in which the possibility that you might have poisoned yourself by eating that berry happens. The wondering whether you have been poisoned is the internal version of wondering what is around that corner. What do we call that tone? Well, it’s great, because we name it after the Greek for everything. We call it Panic. The Great God Pan and the Pan quality, which we call panic. Panic then really means everythingness, the realization that everything is happening. But everything-feel isn’t a lovely total thing. Everything means that there are so many incommensurate levels, so many shadows, so many specters. I like the word panic here because it also suggests a kind of quivering movement. Panic isn’t static—it tends to rush around or at least shiver on its own somewhere. We are beginning to notice that true fullness in the end is movement, always expanding, expansiveness…fullness of being isn’t some static thing to be achieved, but a dynamic process. Marx says it’s really like how production is actually the same as consumption, which by the way is the best way to start thinking about Marxist readings of poems, not as reflections of the freakin economy in which they were supposedly written. Plucking an apricot and putting it to your nose so you can smell that rose scent just after it’s fallen off a tree, then putting it in your mouth, chewing, swallowing…all that stuff is production. If that doesn’t speak volumes about the ways “act” and “behave” or “suffer” or “experience” have been violently severed and with violent consequences, I don’t know what would. Even in Marx—sorry to the Hegelian Marxist in Langston Hughes—produce doesn’t mean “let there be light” or pulling a rabbit out of a hat. It means something much more like “appreciate” or even “consume.” In one letter, Marx says that humans begin by production, “that is,” he says immediately, “by eating and drinking.” To eat or drink something you have to go along with it. If you’re a single celled organism, you have to envelop it…gulp! OMG did I just swallow poison? Again, this is the default phenomenology of symbiosis, a radical hospitality, giving rise to the possibility that the guest we let in might destroy us. To sag is to sink or subside gradually…think about how all the stuff that might happen to the dream has a really different temporality to it. Rotting is what happens to a corpse and one can’t help but visualize the history of lynching and the song “Strange Fruit.” Becoming glazed with sugar might take longer than rotting, if we were thinking about an item of food. Sagging has to do with just persisting but without being used by us. And exploding might be the sudden catastrophe that results when sagging has gone on for a while, or glazing, or rotting. (**) What we are experiencing in this poem is discarded, unutilized pleasure. What is wrong with society, according to this logic, is not that there is too much pleasure in capitalism or consumerism. It’s that there’s not enough. Look—you just chucked that carton of juice away and you hadn’t even finished it. Now we have to get in the car and go to the water park, and you’ll be thirsty. It’s hard perhaps to deal with, in an ecology talk, in a country whose growth in the nineteenth century was a way to enact the fantasies of working class European immigrants, so that when you walk down Main Street, you are walking inside their heads—the heads that imagine what those rich posh people must be eating while you’re starving on potatoes: all the meat and white bread they must be eating, eventually turned into easy to handle hamburgers, the Land of Cockaygne “All you can eat,” big gulp fantasy that has done a great job so far of almost destroying Earth, America, the biggest pile of Europe ever—a place where by the side of the road you might find a gigantic shoe not made by Claes Oldenburg but by some local guy, the biggest this, the most amount of that, eventually requiring feedlots and planet death. It’s hard to swallow for us eco people, brought up on the necessity—and let’s face it the stylistic distinction—of being abstemious. It’s hard to swallow that what ecological politics might be about is more pleasure and not less, and that thus in consumerism there is a distorted not fully nice version of the kind of pleasure we might expect if, say, keeping polar bears or coral alive was higher up on our agenda. But that’s exactly the imagery in this poem—if you don’t try to enact it, the dream could rot or bloom with sugar or sag and explode, scattering its possibilities and causing unintended damage—and I suggest that since it’s a key, major part of the poetics of anti-racism and the struggle of African American people, and since this struggle is key to an ecological politics, we shouldn’t ignore that imagery. The poem is talking about interpretation, in lots of ways. The dream deferred is, as I pointed out earlier, the full meaning of the poem, which haunts the sentences like a shadow from the future. Dreams are like that, says Freud: they are infinitely interpretable. But what does infinity mean? If you try to count up to it, you won’t be able to, so the idea that it means “going on and on forever” is a dangerous illusion, an ideological one I would argue. Infinity means you can’t count it. There might be three of whatever it is, but you can’t know that in advance. There might be twenty million, but a thing stops somewhere. Interpretation stops somewhere. Alan Turing had to invent the idea of computers to prove that things stop somewhere. You can’t make a program powerful enough to predict when every other program will go into an infinite loop. Turing was trying to prove Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem. A logical system must be flawed in order to exist so you can make it go into an infinite loop. And you can’t design an uber meta program that can predict (aka the future…) when any other algorithm will go into an infinite loop…which means that the future is open, like how poems are, because there must always be some opacity in a logical system in order for it to be transparent, or true. Godel created his theorem because about Russell and Whitehead were trying to police mathematician Cantor (a mathematician like Godel), police him with logic. Cantor discovered infinities that were ‘bigger” than regular. And infinity truly means you can’t count (compute) it, not it goes on forever…in between Hilbert was wondering whether computational processes could be seen to stop (the Entscheidungsproblem)…it’s like they invented computers to prove that computers can’t do everything…and then the Max 8 showed up… And in parallel this war between logic and math halfway through the twentieth century, like “Harlem,” like the Golden Spike in global warming data that scientists point to in 1945, this war between logic and math is about Tarski inventing the idea of metalanguage to police sentences like “this sentence is false”—you can always invent a sentence that will blow up the rule…like how Lacan says there is no metalanguage… The infinite openness of futurality is what the essence of a thing is, as opposed to its appearance, which is if you think about it the past. Automated systems such as economies or programs that make planes crash are past states of thought and feeling encoded in rules, customs, habits, lines of code. The trouble with automation is not artificial intelligence—heaven knows I may be an android. The trouble with automation is that the past is eating the future. Automation, if the past sucked, and generally it does, can you tell?—means alienation. Openness and finitude thus go together. Another way of saying what the mathematicians are saying against the western logicians, is that there’s at least one level on which you or your interpretation or your action, whatever it may be, suck(s). Some lifeform you didn’t think about gets killed or eventually you get cancer because you ate too many of whatever in whatever particular way. Ecological awareness, meaning you realize things happen on lots of space and time scales at once, means knowing that at some point at least you are a hypocrite. You can’t get it perfect. Not knowing when an entity wil come to an end is thus part of panic, the basic ecological mood, the great god Pan. You that a thing is flawed, that it will stop, but you can’t know exactly when or how, at least not for everything. Will mass extinction wipe us out, and when? It’s like that. It’s a good time to panic and think and do something about it. Sugar is a thing that evokes both Nature and culture, civilization and barbarism, pleasure and slavery. And in Hughes’s poem, a sugary death is only one way of thinking about the dream. The poem explodes the difference between coating a thing with sugar and letting that thing glaze itself—culture and nature. Nature and culture both now explode in the face of ecological awareness, evaporating in the face of what I like to call the symbiotic real—the fact of being in a biosphere where exorbitant and always risky mutual aid is in effect everywhere. The blankness of the page is the automated zombie apocalypse—it’s whiteness eating your brain with memes, stopping you from thinking, obtruding on the dream like a huge hot parking lot surrounding a carton of orange juice. Sagging suggests just letting gravity, aka spacetime, do its thing, a kind of existing in indifference. It’s not about stasis--it’s moving. Sagging is an abject movement that could indeed explode from the inside as slime as much as fire, like ectoplasm, the spectral body fluid; sagging is about physical being and time, “going out of shape” and getting old…Environmental creepiness is there in that racist southern gothic mood, half detected in “Harlem” and fully there in “Strange Fruit,” the weight of the past sagging or weighing like a nightmare. The futurality of things (the dream deferred) could sag in the toxic atmosphere of automation…the plane that can’t crash, the ship that can’t sink—didn’t we learn anything from the Titanic or from Titanic? Leonardo di Caprio would be pulped in a malfunctioning Max 8, that massively distributed Titanic. You can’t even make a romantic film about it. Is that progress?" />
<meta property="og:description" content="Public lecture delivered April, 2019, to culminate the first ECOPOESIS gathering at California College of the Arts, San Francisco “The idea that alienation is being cut off from the future, the possibility that things might be different, has become very easy to think, and very good to think. All this has some consequences for art.” “Most ecological and plenty of non-ecological theories of alienation exist. Most of them state that we are alienated from a past where things were better, or perfect. But this is just the notion of the Fall, translated into some other mode, and that narrative is one way in which agricultural societies talk about the damage they have already done. The inherent speciesism (“nature” versus human culture) of this model is historically bankrolled by racism and patriarchy. There’s another way of thinking about alienation, logically, and luckily there are ways of showing that it’s true: if we aren’t alienated from the past we are alienated from the future. The media tell us that we are approaching the end of the world, because of global warming, but it’s much more serious than that. We are approaching us being dead and children now growing up and having to live in this biosphere, for a long time—longer than the end of time, in any case. The idea that alienation is being cut off from the future, the possibility that things might be different, has become very easy to think, and very good to think. All this has some consequences for art. What happens to a dream deferred? Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun? Or fester like a sore— And then run? Does it stink like rotten meat? Or crust and sugar over— like a syrupy sweet? Maybe it just sags like a heavy load. Or does it explode? This is a poem called “Harlem” and it’s by Langston Hughes. Let’s start to read it. Okay, well who wrote this poem? Langston Hughes would be the easiest answer. But all kinds of author functions, as Foucault used to say, exist. Maybe it’s better to say “Who or what wrote the poem?” It’s quite common for example to reduce Marxist criticism to its vulgar version, where you square the poem with the economic conditions of the day, say about a decade, in the country in which it was written. That Tennyson poem is a typical product of 1840s industrial capitalism in Britain. This Hughes poem is a typical product of 1950s American capitalism. Or whatever. So who wrote the poem? A human being? The human being’s family or psychic issues? The human being’s unconscious? The culture the human lived in? How many do we include? Who wrote the poem? Capitalism? The human genome? The biosphere? The ecosystem around the human poet? A light fall of rain one morning? The climate? The nuclear industry? The military industrial complex? The structure of racism in mid-twentieth century America? The struggle of African Americans to achieve basic rights? You see the thing is, ecological awareness is all about beginning to realize that things are happening on all kinds of scales, all at once, and that these scales aren’t like how you encounter them in museums or online. You can’t toggle nicely and smoothly back and forth from the very small to the very large, from the micro to the macro. That micro macro talk is Neoplatonic medieval something or other anyway. All right, let’s try something else. When was the poem written? The early twentieth century? The week Hughes put pen to paper? The month? One year in his life? The time of modernity? The time of modernism? The time of post-Neolithic civilization? The time of humans on Earth? In a way the poem was written in all of these times. Right? Just like in a way, all the beings I listed earlier wrote the poem. Let’s think about another aspect of the poem. Let’s think about the physical media of which it’s composed. Paper, typewriter ink; pixels, glass screens; microfilm. Roman Jakobson has a clunky but interesting six-part model of communication, that is useful in the way that all structuralist interpretative devices are useful, which is the way in which magic mixers that can slice and dice your food five different ways are useful. Put the poem through the blender, you learn something from what the blender does to it. So the first thing you notice is, there are these spacious gaps between some of the lines, while some other lines are close together. The first line, “What happens to a dream deferred?” has a lot of space around it—it’s trying to make you think, but it’s also trying to make you feel something, the opaque weight of all that deferment. It’s a tight little poem, whose lines have two or three rhythmical feet, and that means that unlike a wall of words, the space around the poem and between the stanzas is highlighted and becomes part of how you read it—you have to find some way to pronounce the blankness at the end of each line. In a way the poem a little bit lonely, like discarded little carton of orange juice that you find one day lying in an empty parking lot—not enough people are noticing what it’s saying. Or, conversely, the poem is trapped in a bath of blankness, pressing in on all sides—if you think about the parking lot the same way, it’s the same thing. something huge and constructed and blank yet weirdly invisible because it’s so hard to see presses in on our powers of thought and our physical powers on all sides. Your feet ache and you feel lonely and you regret the absence of butterflies. (The poem isn’t going to tell you. Poems let themselves be opaque altogether, like that parking lot, or we let them, or both. That means that poems are a place where what I like to call the future future gathers—the radical freshness that enables the possibility that things might be different, rather than the one we can build out from where we are now, using prediction and extrapolation. Again, my point is that we are alienated from the future, not from the past. we aren’t trying to recover an Edenic meaning that the poet somehow hid in there like a message in a bottle. We’re trying to assess the scope and awesomeness of this particular futural gateway.) The weight of deferment—the weight of waiting, as a matter of fact—is legible in the way the poem organizes the medium in which it has been inscribed—the so called “space” is actually the obtruding presence of the physical medium in which the poem exists. Say it’s on paper, well in that case, there’s a lot of pulp, trees, water, sunlight, all the things that make trees that make paper, in that pause. It’s not nothing. It’s not silence, as John Cage would have said—silence is just the way socially determined sounds taper off and you get to hear something else. It’s something I love about the Laser Interferometry Gravitational Observatory, about two miles north west of New Orleans, which is sort of Houston’s sister city. Two laser beams at right angles. It’s a very simple and relatively cheap experiment, compared at any rate with CERN. It’s tens of millions rather than billions, and there’s a difference, although it may seem absurdly expensive to us. At LIGO, these two lasers are bouncing off carefully calibrated mirrors. They pick up everything. Everything. Like cattle walking over the cattle grid in the field outside. People having arguments in an adjoining room about the experiment. Cars going past on the road outside. And you know what’s most uncanny is, if you know the waveforms for these things, you can subtract them from the waveform that results from the vibrating lasers. The movement of tectonic plates; the sound of aircraft…the lasers pick up everything, and when you cut out those cows walking over the grid and so on (I love the cows part), and there’s a tiny squiggle of something left, that you can’t explain, and it has the right sort of anticipated shape, do you know what is? That thing is a gravity wave. It’s a signature of two black holes colliding, one thousand light years away, a tiny flicker of spacetime in which everything on Earth got a little bit smaller and a little bit slower-living, then a little bit bigger and a little bit faster, then back to normal. Half an hour after the new improved LIGO was switched on, with more carefully calibrated lasers, two black holes collided and the energy equaled the output of the entire universe. And a ripple in spacetime spread out until it passed through everything on Earth. Is it not uncanny—rather like the idea of shadowtime that I was hearing about yesterday evening—that the gravity wave was right there, inside the waveform determined by moocows, cars, people arguing, tectonic plates… Does [the dream deferred] stink like rotten meat? Or crust and sugar over— like a syrupy sweet? Maybe it just sags like a heavy load. Or does it explode? Then you realize that the shadowtime is also in the imagery. The rotting of meat—the way it becomes inedible for humans because it’s being eaten by bacteria—the rotting is commensurate, in a metaphorical sense, with the deferment of the dream of un-alienated fullness of being, the “dream” that Hughes is talking about. It’s an ecological process—the appropriation of something we thought was just for us (it’s called “meat” not “cows” or “pigs” for this reason), by something else. The something else-ness is what makes the rottenness of the meat disgusting. That’s a thing that can happen in a few days in your kitchen; the racism is a thing that can happen for several hundred years in the hemisphere you live in on Earth. Metaphor is bringing these two timescales close without collapsing them into one another. “This is that,” in the realm of metaphor rather than math, means also that “this is not that.” Rotting time is not the same as dream deferment time. Then there’s the “crust”-ing and the “sugar”-ing over. Perhaps Hughes means that the dream becomes a candified, plastic, purely aesthetic version of itself, easy to understand but impossible to act out, because it’s been reduced to a commodified consumer object. Given the long history of slavery and sugar, this is a potent image indeed. The Romantic poets Coleridge and Southey argued for boycotting sugar in the mid 1790s, arguing that sugar was an extreme metaphor or catachresis: sugar is the crystallized blood of slaves. The implication in the image is that the sugar coating would be a symptom of continuing slavery. If sugar is alienated slave labor, a sugar-coated dream is an alienated one that you can’t realize, only appreciate. The sick part of the sugaring is that the dream might do it to itself, like how chocolate starts to separate and the ingredients rise and sink, something we call chocolate bloom. The sweetness of the dream might rise to the surface, encrust it and make it impossible to live it. The oppressive forces are installed inside of the dream, because the dream is in relation to them, and is born within them. And in an ecological context, if, as I believe, destroying racism would be tantamount to undoing a gigantic amount of the ideologies that sever us from other lifeforms, a severing actively and automatically pursued for thousands of years in what is called civilization, the response to the mid global warming of the Holocene—if destroying racism means that, then “Harlem” is talking obliquely about an ecological politics. Let’s talk about that for a moment—what I mean by that. Economics isn’t about dollars and interest rates. Dollars and interest rates aren’t about dollars and interest rates. All that stuff is reified capitalist theology, aka economics 101 in non-communist universities. Economics is how you organize your enjoyment, how you organize how stuff flows around in your house, your home, your world, all the shit that you have going on. And ecology is how the house, the home, the world that you’ve got going works, the logic of it. Economics and ecology are intertwined, etymologically, logically, socially, everything. So the question is, do these things pertain only to human beings? Do you have cockroaches and rats in or around your home? Do you look after a cat, and is it your house the cat lives in? Since I leave the house a lot more than the cat, in many ways it’s the cat’s house more than mine. This is sort of related to how, when I became a dad, I had that this is not my beautiful house feeling, very quickly, as Claire began to make it very clear that it was her house, not mine—psychologically that’s very true, isn’t it, your parents’ house that you grew up in was much more yours than theirs, it was the first world you lived in. They just happened to rent or buy or whatever another living space in a series. And related to this question, another question of pleasure. If we don’t like the theology of dollars and structural unemployment and having to work to live and all that stuff—if we think we are a bit socialist or Marxist or anarcho-communist whatever—do we think it would be a good idea to include cockroaches and cats in the revolutionary projects we have going on to transmogrify our homes, our worlds, into things that are more pleasurable for the beings who have stuff going on, like trying to find out where the rats really live in my cat’s case, or trying to write a lecture when you’re feeling really depressed about ecological politics and mass extinction in my case, etc? From a utilitarian point of view—which I find deeply problematic but whatever let’s use it, because it’s pretty default in our world—just existing is a form of pleasure. So if there are more revolutionary beings, like hedgehogs with little Che Guevara caps and stuff, that means more pleasure, so involving more lifeforms in revolutionary struggles would be better. Thanks very much for listening, my name is Tim Morton and if you have any questions I’ll be available afterwards. Right. So let’s go back to the poem. There’s the stuff about the dream rotting or glazing itself with sugar. I like very much how the dream immediately is a physical thing, something lying around in the sun. Then there’s another gap, and the idea that the dream might just continue, in an abject sort of way, “sagging” “Like a heavy load”—the dream itself has lost its utopian dreamlike lightness and has itself become one of the things that hangs over your head. In writing this poem, the authors (for Langston Hughes is one of them, but there are many that his work brings into alignment) seem to be observing that a whole complex range of timescales and histories are felt in the deferment of the dream, whose lingering potency is present in its absence in the way the poem organizes the blank space around it. But the blank space isn’t blank. The poem obviously plays with topics such as rotting and producing sugars, or being coated by sugars, processes that are to do with the biochemistry of lifeforms in a biosphere. The gaps in the poem mean that something there, but what is there? The open question quality is legible in the opacity of those gaps. What is there quite literally is the paper or the pixels, and what is there definitely and more figuratively is the labor of black people—what Karl Marx would call the species being of humans. Marx identifies this with imaginative projection and appropriation, but we don’t have to. Let’s just focus on the brute, aka silent, presence of physical being in those gaps, a physical being whose analog are the concrete images of rotting, sugaring and exploding. What is this physical being? The work of slaves, thought in typical western philosophy as a machinic functioning, like the behavior of an algorithm. Slavery articulates the anthropocentric differences between humans and so-called animals: humans, like slave owners, act, while animals, like slaves, merely behave. You can see immediately that the ways we have of talking about this stuff are deeply contaminated by speciesism, and that this has to do with racism, and I’m going to try to sort out exactly how in this talk. Because blank space isn’t just blank, and because the physical medium the poem appears in doesn’t just function smoothly in the background. That’s the whole point—the obtrusion of the paper or pixels into the poem itself is a kind of malfunction, like rotting or sugaring or sagging, and perhaps like exploding: that’s the question the poem poses altogether—is the exploding an error? We know it’s the logical consequence, within the poem, of continuing oppression. But does “explode” mean “explode into life and therefore become dangerous to the white powers that be” or does “explode” mean “evaporate as if it had never existed at all”? The blank space is and isn’t the poem. It’s a place where the poem malfunctions or rather, a place where the poem reveals that one being’s functioning is another being’s malfunction, and more deeply, how lines of poetry and spaces between them and everything else are all a series of malfunctions, such that smoothness is an illusion. Indeed, the deferment and the supposed silence are symptoms of a massive malfunction, in the fully “evil” sense of “mal” as the first syllables of that word. An evil functioning is what is detected in the gaps in the poem, the persistence of a state that has indeed been naturalized—the relations between white and black people—but which is anything but natural; or rather, the smoothness of its supposed naturalness is in fact a symptom of horrific violence, like the peaceful atmosphere after a tornado or bomb test. And isn’t that ecological awareness in a nutshell, really? The fact that since there is always an environment—some kind of opacity, some kind of surrounding something in which things are taking place—that the silence and absence isn’t to do with the reader being stupid or evil. Environmental awareness isn’t about being smarter or wiser than the average person. It’s just how awareness in general is, that it always takes place against some kind of taken for granted structure or background or set of assumptions or rows of beehives or vineyards or sugar plantations…there’s always a shadow side, always a shadowtime—it’s not that if you’re truly ecological there are no shadows. It’s that there are more. You are more haunted than you were. Ecological awareness most certainly is not about seeing things more clearly than Joe Public. Ecological awareness is about being willing to be haunted. We’ll see quite soon just how hard wired into ecology are concepts of specters, ghosts, shadows, fleeting things that appear in the corner of your eye. Ecologica awareness doesn’t mean you exorcised the bad artificial stuff and got back to nature. It mean that a greater number than ever of opaque semi-silent shadowy beings are making soft noises in the margins...it’s something that is powerfully conveyed in Amiri Baraka’s “Something in the Way of Things,” a poem whose paranoid tone aims to delineate the spooky, spectral presence of brutality and exploitation and racism in the fabric of the seemingly quiet street along which the narrator is walking. Paranoia is the default, ground state version of empathy—the more paranoid I am about you, are you really a robot or not, is the way I become more and more interested in you as a person. This whole idea that people are beings who obviously act and animals are beings who obviously behave, like robots, is theological and extreme, and, as I’m already starting to argue if you can feel it, racist. Ecological awareness is not about making other people feel stupid. It’s about realizing that because there’s at least one shadowy corner around which you’re not seeing, you yourself are always stupid. The shadows are infinite because we don’t know in advance how many there are, not because they go on forever. It’s all shadows. The dreams of dead people, waiting to be fulfilled by the living. All the entities that the poem gathers—African American humans, white people, cows and sheep and paper and pixels, all these beings coexist in ways that overlap. You could say for example that the human species is a heap of things such as humans and cows and computers and ideas about knitting and feudal monarchy and sand. And beaches are a heap of things such as sand and humans and waves and seaweed and so on. If you think of the world in terms of hyperobjects you are thinking of the world in terms of lots of gigantic overlapping things that are finite and fuzzy. Who wrote the poem is a heap of inconsistent things. When the poem was written is a heap of inconsistent times. And if you like ecological beings such as meadows and beaches and nice city streets with people being decent together, you had better believe in heaps. Logic, traditional vanilla Western logic that is, makes it almost impossible to believe in heaps. You can take bits out of a heap while still calling it a heap, until there’s nothing left, whereupon you realize that there must be no such things as heaps because look, here’s a whole lot of nothing and you were assuming there was a heap right up to that point. It’s called the Sorites paradox. Clouds, according to this, don’t really exist, because they’re made of little bits of cloud stuff; when you subtract the cloud stuff you get smaller and smaller bits of cloud stuff until there’s nothing—so there are no clouds, because clouds are vague. In the same way, you can argue that the Amazon jungle is just a gigantic feedlot waiting to happen, because if you take trees away there’s still a jungle, and you can keep on going till there’s just one tree, so jungles don’t really exist. But perhaps being vague is a criterion for existing. It certainly doesn’t seem easy to get rid of vague and downright contradictory things, without tying yourself in knots. Furthermore, you have to be a holist of some kind to be ecological. The trouble is, most forms of holism are exclusive and explosive. What do I mean? I mean that maybe we need to think that wholes are vague and messy and contradictory, not like Pan Man beings that eat up their contents and digest them totally. A cow could be part of one hyperobject—the human species thought in a non-essentialist way—and part of another one—the cow species for example, which in an expanded way also includes grass. The last time western philosophy tried to talk about all of whatever we are at once it got it very wrong and said “white man” all the time, like scratch the surface of any human and you’ll find a white man underneath. But humans caused global warming, not dolphins. We had better have an idea of who we are that is real and up to date and not racist or patriarchal. Thinking of ourselves as part of a vague heap of things that aren’t all to do with us exclusively, whoever we think we are, is a good place to start. There really are wholes, but they’re not your grandaddy’s whole, all perfect and fully integrated. Otherwise the whole called human is a totally different world from the world called moocows, and so we might get to thinking that we can do what we want with moocows or just totally ignore them. If we can’t overlap, we can’t communicate. If the concept of word means something self-contained and rigid, there’s no hope at all. And someone can say “My concept of world is much richer than yours, or you don’t have one at all, so I own Australia now.” I reckon this vacuum sealed world concept comes from rigid class hierarchies and I reckon that comes from demarcating the difference between human and nonhuman space using things like walls, because you have created granaries to preserve food from the ravages of mild global warming. You sealed off your human survival temporality, so you justify this by getting to think in various ways that the seal demarcates something real (religion, tragedy, philosophy, however you do it). It’s about 10 000 BCE, and you’re doing the right thing, at your scale, just like how starting your car in the morning doesn’t cause global warming. No, it really doesn’t. you’re not guilty. Besides, eating a bit less meat is much, much more effective than buying a Tesla, and easier too. You justify the demarcations and divisions of labor by explaining that the other classes must be different, really, really different beings altogether. And this is how racism begins to function. And it’s that internal human division that enables speciesism, the imagined difference between humans and everyone else. Think of that great diagram in robotics design, the Uncanny Valley. It explains racism while being racist in itself, so it’s very good to analyze, so we can come up with something else. On one side of the valley is a very suspicious being, the so-called “healthy human being,” and I think we can all hear the normal vs pathological, eugenics resonance in that concept. Exactly what is that, I don’t wonder for more than a second, speaking as we are close to Sacramento where in the early twentieth century horrible eugenics experiments were carried out, such as leaving newborn babies to die in hospital because they were unfit. On the other side of the valley is a cute so-called animal, or their electornic equivalent, the cute droid such as R2D2. They’re cute because they’re different—they’re separated by a thin hard line, which is what the Uncanny Valley looks like when you look across it at R2D2, because of foreshortening. Hitler was fond of his dog Blondi because Blondi was different enough from him, so that he could feel all those nice sublimated cute aggression feelings and make animal rights legislation. Let’s just face it—a lot of environmental organizations have had deep connections with white supremacy, and I’m explaining why. The Uncanny Valley diagram was created because it became well known in robotics that as you came closer and closer to imitating a lifelike human being, the robot passed through a phase that appeared strange or scary or creepy. The ultimate nadir of the Uncanny Valley is the zombie, the animated corpse who is a parody of the Cartesian self, just a body animated by some invisible force, moving in an automated way like the brooms in the Sorcerer’s Apprentice. According to hicks I overheard in rural Colorado (!), the zombie apocalypse is a pretty obviously racist concept about hordes of nonwhite people coming for your property, Barbara, and what’s awesome about many zombie works of art is how they subvert that. Anyway, the nice cute difference between me and R2D2 or Blondi the Alsatian is enabled by all the beings labeled as inhuman, subhuman and so on, beings that racism has chucked into the Uncanny Valley. Speciesism—the rigid difference between a human and a nonhuman—is enabled by racism—the machinery that categorizes some beings as inhuman or subhuman. Until you find out that you are in fact Neanderthals in some way, you tell yourself that they are uncanny failed versions of humans who just behaved like zombies, unlike us who have imagination and can see round corners and figure out how to make the zombies go extinct by slaughtering them all. So the way out of the Valley is actually not to get rid of the uncanny, which would make everything into a cute little machine coexisting in some fascist medium, we are all Earthlings or whatever, but actually the way out is to jump into the Valley, to realize that we ourselves are uncanny beings, that being a lifeform at all is being uncanny, because you are strangely strange all the way down. Because you are a symbiotic product of a truly random series of mutations called evolution. Which means that there is no Valley, because there is no healthy human being or perfect cute R2D2. Ecological awareness is like realizing you are on a gigantic flat plain on which exist all kinds of hazy weird beings whose status as alive or not alive, sentient or not sentient, conscious or not conscious (and even existing or not-existing) is not settled, but disturbed at every point. Again, ecological awareness doesn’t mean you stuck your head in a tree and forgot all your problems. It means you allowed yourself to be more haunted than ever, and in particular, that founding religious difference between act and behave that gives you humans versus everything else, imagination versus computing, let there be light versus being a slave, and all that toxic stuff, that act/behave boundary is not erased so that everything is a machine (which means there is still a perfume of act versus behave going on somewhere), but that everything is profoundly ambiguous. You can’t tell whether I am an android or not, and that’s what makes you treat me like a person. You don’t have to prove that rocks are definitely alive, you just have to notice that “alive” or “conscious” means I’m paranoid that you might be a zombie. Coexisting in symbiosis means you might have swallowed poison, and you did—it’s called being alive, which kills you in the end. There was no true difference between you and the cats and the vultures. The difference was enabled by difference between yourself and other humans. So what is the basic tone of a reality in which being haunted is the basic background to everything? This is the same as the reality in which the possibility that you might have poisoned yourself by eating that berry happens. The wondering whether you have been poisoned is the internal version of wondering what is around that corner. What do we call that tone? Well, it’s great, because we name it after the Greek for everything. We call it Panic. The Great God Pan and the Pan quality, which we call panic. Panic then really means everythingness, the realization that everything is happening. But everything-feel isn’t a lovely total thing. Everything means that there are so many incommensurate levels, so many shadows, so many specters. I like the word panic here because it also suggests a kind of quivering movement. Panic isn’t static—it tends to rush around or at least shiver on its own somewhere. We are beginning to notice that true fullness in the end is movement, always expanding, expansiveness…fullness of being isn’t some static thing to be achieved, but a dynamic process. Marx says it’s really like how production is actually the same as consumption, which by the way is the best way to start thinking about Marxist readings of poems, not as reflections of the freakin economy in which they were supposedly written. Plucking an apricot and putting it to your nose so you can smell that rose scent just after it’s fallen off a tree, then putting it in your mouth, chewing, swallowing…all that stuff is production. If that doesn’t speak volumes about the ways “act” and “behave” or “suffer” or “experience” have been violently severed and with violent consequences, I don’t know what would. Even in Marx—sorry to the Hegelian Marxist in Langston Hughes—produce doesn’t mean “let there be light” or pulling a rabbit out of a hat. It means something much more like “appreciate” or even “consume.” In one letter, Marx says that humans begin by production, “that is,” he says immediately, “by eating and drinking.” To eat or drink something you have to go along with it. If you’re a single celled organism, you have to envelop it…gulp! OMG did I just swallow poison? Again, this is the default phenomenology of symbiosis, a radical hospitality, giving rise to the possibility that the guest we let in might destroy us. To sag is to sink or subside gradually…think about how all the stuff that might happen to the dream has a really different temporality to it. Rotting is what happens to a corpse and one can’t help but visualize the history of lynching and the song “Strange Fruit.” Becoming glazed with sugar might take longer than rotting, if we were thinking about an item of food. Sagging has to do with just persisting but without being used by us. And exploding might be the sudden catastrophe that results when sagging has gone on for a while, or glazing, or rotting. (**) What we are experiencing in this poem is discarded, unutilized pleasure. What is wrong with society, according to this logic, is not that there is too much pleasure in capitalism or consumerism. It’s that there’s not enough. Look—you just chucked that carton of juice away and you hadn’t even finished it. Now we have to get in the car and go to the water park, and you’ll be thirsty. It’s hard perhaps to deal with, in an ecology talk, in a country whose growth in the nineteenth century was a way to enact the fantasies of working class European immigrants, so that when you walk down Main Street, you are walking inside their heads—the heads that imagine what those rich posh people must be eating while you’re starving on potatoes: all the meat and white bread they must be eating, eventually turned into easy to handle hamburgers, the Land of Cockaygne “All you can eat,” big gulp fantasy that has done a great job so far of almost destroying Earth, America, the biggest pile of Europe ever—a place where by the side of the road you might find a gigantic shoe not made by Claes Oldenburg but by some local guy, the biggest this, the most amount of that, eventually requiring feedlots and planet death. It’s hard to swallow for us eco people, brought up on the necessity—and let’s face it the stylistic distinction—of being abstemious. It’s hard to swallow that what ecological politics might be about is more pleasure and not less, and that thus in consumerism there is a distorted not fully nice version of the kind of pleasure we might expect if, say, keeping polar bears or coral alive was higher up on our agenda. But that’s exactly the imagery in this poem—if you don’t try to enact it, the dream could rot or bloom with sugar or sag and explode, scattering its possibilities and causing unintended damage—and I suggest that since it’s a key, major part of the poetics of anti-racism and the struggle of African American people, and since this struggle is key to an ecological politics, we shouldn’t ignore that imagery. The poem is talking about interpretation, in lots of ways. The dream deferred is, as I pointed out earlier, the full meaning of the poem, which haunts the sentences like a shadow from the future. Dreams are like that, says Freud: they are infinitely interpretable. But what does infinity mean? If you try to count up to it, you won’t be able to, so the idea that it means “going on and on forever” is a dangerous illusion, an ideological one I would argue. Infinity means you can’t count it. There might be three of whatever it is, but you can’t know that in advance. There might be twenty million, but a thing stops somewhere. Interpretation stops somewhere. Alan Turing had to invent the idea of computers to prove that things stop somewhere. You can’t make a program powerful enough to predict when every other program will go into an infinite loop. Turing was trying to prove Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem. A logical system must be flawed in order to exist so you can make it go into an infinite loop. And you can’t design an uber meta program that can predict (aka the future…) when any other algorithm will go into an infinite loop…which means that the future is open, like how poems are, because there must always be some opacity in a logical system in order for it to be transparent, or true. Godel created his theorem because about Russell and Whitehead were trying to police mathematician Cantor (a mathematician like Godel), police him with logic. Cantor discovered infinities that were ‘bigger” than regular. And infinity truly means you can’t count (compute) it, not it goes on forever…in between Hilbert was wondering whether computational processes could be seen to stop (the Entscheidungsproblem)…it’s like they invented computers to prove that computers can’t do everything…and then the Max 8 showed up… And in parallel this war between logic and math halfway through the twentieth century, like “Harlem,” like the Golden Spike in global warming data that scientists point to in 1945, this war between logic and math is about Tarski inventing the idea of metalanguage to police sentences like “this sentence is false”—you can always invent a sentence that will blow up the rule…like how Lacan says there is no metalanguage… The infinite openness of futurality is what the essence of a thing is, as opposed to its appearance, which is if you think about it the past. Automated systems such as economies or programs that make planes crash are past states of thought and feeling encoded in rules, customs, habits, lines of code. The trouble with automation is not artificial intelligence—heaven knows I may be an android. The trouble with automation is that the past is eating the future. Automation, if the past sucked, and generally it does, can you tell?—means alienation. Openness and finitude thus go together. Another way of saying what the mathematicians are saying against the western logicians, is that there’s at least one level on which you or your interpretation or your action, whatever it may be, suck(s). Some lifeform you didn’t think about gets killed or eventually you get cancer because you ate too many of whatever in whatever particular way. Ecological awareness, meaning you realize things happen on lots of space and time scales at once, means knowing that at some point at least you are a hypocrite. You can’t get it perfect. Not knowing when an entity wil come to an end is thus part of panic, the basic ecological mood, the great god Pan. You that a thing is flawed, that it will stop, but you can’t know exactly when or how, at least not for everything. Will mass extinction wipe us out, and when? It’s like that. It’s a good time to panic and think and do something about it. Sugar is a thing that evokes both Nature and culture, civilization and barbarism, pleasure and slavery. And in Hughes’s poem, a sugary death is only one way of thinking about the dream. The poem explodes the difference between coating a thing with sugar and letting that thing glaze itself—culture and nature. Nature and culture both now explode in the face of ecological awareness, evaporating in the face of what I like to call the symbiotic real—the fact of being in a biosphere where exorbitant and always risky mutual aid is in effect everywhere. The blankness of the page is the automated zombie apocalypse—it’s whiteness eating your brain with memes, stopping you from thinking, obtruding on the dream like a huge hot parking lot surrounding a carton of orange juice. Sagging suggests just letting gravity, aka spacetime, do its thing, a kind of existing in indifference. It’s not about stasis--it’s moving. Sagging is an abject movement that could indeed explode from the inside as slime as much as fire, like ectoplasm, the spectral body fluid; sagging is about physical being and time, “going out of shape” and getting old…Environmental creepiness is there in that racist southern gothic mood, half detected in “Harlem” and fully there in “Strange Fruit,” the weight of the past sagging or weighing like a nightmare. The futurality of things (the dream deferred) could sag in the toxic atmosphere of automation…the plane that can’t crash, the ship that can’t sink—didn’t we learn anything from the Titanic or from Titanic? Leonardo di Caprio would be pulped in a malfunctioning Max 8, that massively distributed Titanic. You can’t even make a romantic film about it. Is that progress?" />

All this has some consequences for art.” “Most ecological and plenty of non-ecological theories of alienation exist. Most of them state that we are alienated from a past where things were better, or perfect. But this is just the notion of the Fall, translated into some other mode, and that narrative is one way in which agricultural societies talk about the damage they have already done. The inherent speciesism (“nature” versus human culture) of this model is historically bankrolled by racism and patriarchy. There’s another way of thinking about alienation, logically, and luckily there are ways of showing that it’s true: if we aren’t alienated from the past we are alienated from the future. The media tell us that we are approaching the end of the world, because of global warming, but it’s much more serious than that. We are approaching us being dead and children now growing up and having to live in this biosphere, for a long time—longer than the end of time, in any case. The idea that alienation is being cut off from the future, the possibility that things might be different, has become very easy to think, and very good to think. All this has some consequences for art. What happens to a dream deferred? Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun? Or fester like a sore— And then run? Does it stink like rotten meat? Or crust and sugar over— like a syrupy sweet? Maybe it just sags like a heavy load. Or does it explode? This is a poem called “Harlem” and it’s by Langston Hughes. Let’s start to read it. Okay, well who wrote this poem? Langston Hughes would be the easiest answer. But all kinds of author functions, as Foucault used to say, exist. Maybe it’s better to say “Who or what wrote the poem?” It’s quite common for example to reduce Marxist criticism to its vulgar version, where you square the poem with the economic conditions of the day, say about a decade, in the country in which it was written. That Tennyson poem is a typical product of 1840s industrial capitalism in Britain. This Hughes poem is a typical product of 1950s American capitalism. Or whatever. So who wrote the poem? A human being? The human being’s family or psychic issues? The human being’s unconscious? The culture the human lived in? How many do we include? Who wrote the poem? Capitalism? The human genome? The biosphere? The ecosystem around the human poet? A light fall of rain one morning? The climate? The nuclear industry? The military industrial complex? The structure of racism in mid-twentieth century America? The struggle of African Americans to achieve basic rights? You see the thing is, ecological awareness is all about beginning to realize that things are happening on all kinds of scales, all at once, and that these scales aren’t like how you encounter them in museums or online. You can’t toggle nicely and smoothly back and forth from the very small to the very large, from the micro to the macro. That micro macro talk is Neoplatonic medieval something or other anyway. All right, let’s try something else. When was the poem written? The early twentieth century? The week Hughes put pen to paper? The month? One year in his life? The time of modernity? The time of modernism? The time of post-Neolithic civilization? The time of humans on Earth? In a way the poem was written in all of these times. Right? Just like in a way, all the beings I listed earlier wrote the poem. Let’s think about another aspect of the poem. Let’s think about the physical media of which it’s composed. Paper, typewriter ink; pixels, glass screens; microfilm. Roman Jakobson has a clunky but interesting six-part model of communication, that is useful in the way that all structuralist interpretative devices are useful, which is the way in which magic mixers that can slice and dice your food five different ways are useful. Put the poem through the blender, you learn something from what the blender does to it. So the first thing you notice is, there are these spacious gaps between some of the lines, while some other lines are close together. The first line, “What happens to a dream deferred?” has a lot of space around it—it’s trying to make you think, but it’s also trying to make you feel something, the opaque weight of all that deferment. It’s a tight little poem, whose lines have two or three rhythmical feet, and that means that unlike a wall of words, the space around the poem and between the stanzas is highlighted and becomes part of how you read it—you have to find some way to pronounce the blankness at the end of each line. In a way the poem a little bit lonely, like discarded little carton of orange juice that you find one day lying in an empty parking lot—not enough people are noticing what it’s saying. Or, conversely, the poem is trapped in a bath of blankness, pressing in on all sides—if you think about the parking lot the same way, it’s the same thing. something huge and constructed and blank yet weirdly invisible because it’s so hard to see presses in on our powers of thought and our physical powers on all sides. Your feet ache and you feel lonely and you regret the absence of butterflies. (The poem isn’t going to tell you. Poems let themselves be opaque altogether, like that parking lot, or we let them, or both. That means that poems are a place where what I like to call the future future gathers—the radical freshness that enables the possibility that things might be different, rather than the one we can build out from where we are now, using prediction and extrapolation. Again, my point is that we are alienated from the future, not from the past. we aren’t trying to recover an Edenic meaning that the poet somehow hid in there like a message in a bottle. We’re trying to assess the scope and awesomeness of this particular futural gateway.) The weight of deferment—the weight of waiting, as a matter of fact—is legible in the way the poem organizes the medium in which it has been inscribed—the so called “space” is actually the obtruding presence of the physical medium in which the poem exists. Say it’s on paper, well in that case, there’s a lot of pulp, trees, water, sunlight, all the things that make trees that make paper, in that pause. It’s not nothing. It’s not silence, as John Cage would have said—silence is just the way socially determined sounds taper off and you get to hear something else. It’s something I love about the Laser Interferometry Gravitational Observatory, about two miles north west of New Orleans, which is sort of Houston’s sister city. Two laser beams at right angles. It’s a very simple and relatively cheap experiment, compared at any rate with CERN. It’s tens of millions rather than billions, and there’s a difference, although it may seem absurdly expensive to us. At LIGO, these two lasers are bouncing off carefully calibrated mirrors. They pick up everything. Everything. Like cattle walking over the cattle grid in the field outside. People having arguments in an adjoining room about the experiment. Cars going past on the road outside. And you know what’s most uncanny is, if you know the waveforms for these things, you can subtract them from the waveform that results from the vibrating lasers. The movement of tectonic plates; the sound of aircraft…the lasers pick up everything, and when you cut out those cows walking over the grid and so on (I love the cows part), and there’s a tiny squiggle of something left, that you can’t explain, and it has the right sort of anticipated shape, do you know what is? That thing is a gravity wave. It’s a signature of two black holes colliding, one thousand light years away, a tiny flicker of spacetime in which everything on Earth got a little bit smaller and a little bit slower-living, then a little bit bigger and a little bit faster, then back to normal. Half an hour after the new improved LIGO was switched on, with more carefully calibrated lasers, two black holes collided and the energy equaled the output of the entire universe. And a ripple in spacetime spread out until it passed through everything on Earth. Is it not uncanny—rather like the idea of shadowtime that I was hearing about yesterday evening—that the gravity wave was right there, inside the waveform determined by moocows, cars, people arguing, tectonic plates… Does [the dream deferred] stink like rotten meat? Or crust and sugar over— like a syrupy sweet? Maybe it just sags like a heavy load. Or does it explode? Then you realize that the shadowtime is also in the imagery. The rotting of meat—the way it becomes inedible for humans because it’s being eaten by bacteria—the rotting is commensurate, in a metaphorical sense, with the deferment of the dream of un-alienated fullness of being, the “dream” that Hughes is talking about. It’s an ecological process—the appropriation of something we thought was just for us (it’s called “meat” not “cows” or “pigs” for this reason), by something else. The something else-ness is what makes the rottenness of the meat disgusting. That’s a thing that can happen in a few days in your kitchen; the racism is a thing that can happen for several hundred years in the hemisphere you live in on Earth. Metaphor is bringing these two timescales close without collapsing them into one another. “This is that,” in the realm of metaphor rather than math, means also that “this is not that.” Rotting time is not the same as dream deferment time. Then there’s the “crust”-ing and the “sugar”-ing over. Perhaps Hughes means that the dream becomes a candified, plastic, purely aesthetic version of itself, easy to understand but impossible to act out, because it’s been reduced to a commodified consumer object. Given the long history of slavery and sugar, this is a potent image indeed. The Romantic poets Coleridge and Southey argued for boycotting sugar in the mid 1790s, arguing that sugar was an extreme metaphor or catachresis: sugar is the crystallized blood of slaves. The implication in the image is that the sugar coating would be a symptom of continuing slavery. If sugar is alienated slave labor, a sugar-coated dream is an alienated one that you can’t realize, only appreciate. The sick part of the sugaring is that the dream might do it to itself, like how chocolate starts to separate and the ingredients rise and sink, something we call chocolate bloom. The sweetness of the dream might rise to the surface, encrust it and make it impossible to live it. The oppressive forces are installed inside of the dream, because the dream is in relation to them, and is born within them. And in an ecological context, if, as I believe, destroying racism would be tantamount to undoing a gigantic amount of the ideologies that sever us from other lifeforms, a severing actively and automatically pursued for thousands of years in what is called civilization, the response to the mid global warming of the Holocene—if destroying racism means that, then “Harlem” is talking obliquely about an ecological politics. Let’s talk about that for a moment—what I mean by that. Economics isn’t about dollars and interest rates. Dollars and interest rates aren’t about dollars and interest rates. All that stuff is reified capitalist theology, aka economics 101 in non-communist universities. Economics is how you organize your enjoyment, how you organize how stuff flows around in your house, your home, your world, all the shit that you have going on. And ecology is how the house, the home, the world that you’ve got going works, the logic of it. Economics and ecology are intertwined, etymologically, logically, socially, everything. So the question is, do these things pertain only to human beings? Do you have cockroaches and rats in or around your home? Do you look after a cat, and is it your house the cat lives in? Since I leave the house a lot more than the cat, in many ways it’s the cat’s house more than mine. This is sort of related to how, when I became a dad, I had that this is not my beautiful house feeling, very quickly, as Claire began to make it very clear that it was her house, not mine—psychologically that’s very true, isn’t it, your parents’ house that you grew up in was much more yours than theirs, it was the first world you lived in. They just happened to rent or buy or whatever another living space in a series. And related to this question, another question of pleasure. If we don’t like the theology of dollars and structural unemployment and having to work to live and all that stuff—if we think we are a bit socialist or Marxist or anarcho-communist whatever—do we think it would be a good idea to include cockroaches and cats in the revolutionary projects we have going on to transmogrify our homes, our worlds, into things that are more pleasurable for the beings who have stuff going on, like trying to find out where the rats really live in my cat’s case, or trying to write a lecture when you’re feeling really depressed about ecological politics and mass extinction in my case, etc? From a utilitarian point of view—which I find deeply problematic but whatever let’s use it, because it’s pretty default in our world—just existing is a form of pleasure. So if there are more revolutionary beings, like hedgehogs with little Che Guevara caps and stuff, that means more pleasure, so involving more lifeforms in revolutionary struggles would be better. Thanks very much for listening, my name is Tim Morton and if you have any questions I’ll be available afterwards. Right. So let’s go back to the poem. There’s the stuff about the dream rotting or glazing itself with sugar. I like very much how the dream immediately is a physical thing, something lying around in the sun. Then there’s another gap, and the idea that the dream might just continue, in an abject sort of way, “sagging” “Like a heavy load”—the dream itself has lost its utopian dreamlike lightness and has itself become one of the things that hangs over your head. In writing this poem, the authors (for Langston Hughes is one of them, but there are many that his work brings into alignment) seem to be observing that a whole complex range of timescales and histories are felt in the deferment of the dream, whose lingering potency is present in its absence in the way the poem organizes the blank space around it. But the blank space isn’t blank. The poem obviously plays with topics such as rotting and producing sugars, or being coated by sugars, processes that are to do with the biochemistry of lifeforms in a biosphere. The gaps in the poem mean that something there, but what is there? The open question quality is legible in the opacity of those gaps. What is there quite literally is the paper or the pixels, and what is there definitely and more figuratively is the labor of black people—what Karl Marx would call the species being of humans. Marx identifies this with imaginative projection and appropriation, but we don’t have to. Let’s just focus on the brute, aka silent, presence of physical being in those gaps, a physical being whose analog are the concrete images of rotting, sugaring and exploding. What is this physical being? The work of slaves, thought in typical western philosophy as a machinic functioning, like the behavior of an algorithm. Slavery articulates the anthropocentric differences between humans and so-called animals: humans, like slave owners, act, while animals, like slaves, merely behave. You can see immediately that the ways we have of talking about this stuff are deeply contaminated by speciesism, and that this has to do with racism, and I’m going to try to sort out exactly how in this talk. Because blank space isn’t just blank, and because the physical medium the poem appears in doesn’t just function smoothly in the background. That’s the whole point—the obtrusion of the paper or pixels into the poem itself is a kind of malfunction, like rotting or sugaring or sagging, and perhaps like exploding: that’s the question the poem poses altogether—is the exploding an error? We know it’s the logical consequence, within the poem, of continuing oppression. But does “explode” mean “explode into life and therefore become dangerous to the white powers that be” or does “explode” mean “evaporate as if it had never existed at all”? The blank space is and isn’t the poem. It’s a place where the poem malfunctions or rather, a place where the poem reveals that one being’s functioning is another being’s malfunction, and more deeply, how lines of poetry and spaces between them and everything else are all a series of malfunctions, such that smoothness is an illusion. Indeed, the deferment and the supposed silence are symptoms of a massive malfunction, in the fully “evil” sense of “mal” as the first syllables of that word. An evil functioning is what is detected in the gaps in the poem, the persistence of a state that has indeed been naturalized—the relations between white and black people—but which is anything but natural; or rather, the smoothness of its supposed naturalness is in fact a symptom of horrific violence, like the peaceful atmosphere after a tornado or bomb test. And isn’t that ecological awareness in a nutshell, really? The fact that since there is always an environment—some kind of opacity, some kind of surrounding something in which things are taking place—that the silence and absence isn’t to do with the reader being stupid or evil. Environmental awareness isn’t about being smarter or wiser than the average person. It’s just how awareness in general is, that it always takes place against some kind of taken for granted structure or background or set of assumptions or rows of beehives or vineyards or sugar plantations…there’s always a shadow side, always a shadowtime—it’s not that if you’re truly ecological there are no shadows. It’s that there are more. You are more haunted than you were. Ecological awareness most certainly is not about seeing things more clearly than Joe Public. Ecological awareness is about being willing to be haunted. We’ll see quite soon just how hard wired into ecology are concepts of specters, ghosts, shadows, fleeting things that appear in the corner of your eye. Ecologica awareness doesn’t mean you exorcised the bad artificial stuff and got back to nature. It mean that a greater number than ever of opaque semi-silent shadowy beings are making soft noises in the margins...it’s something that is powerfully conveyed in Amiri Baraka’s “Something in the Way of Things,” a poem whose paranoid tone aims to delineate the spooky, spectral presence of brutality and exploitation and racism in the fabric of the seemingly quiet street along which the narrator is walking. Paranoia is the default, ground state version of empathy—the more paranoid I am about you, are you really a robot or not, is the way I become more and more interested in you as a person. This whole idea that people are beings who obviously act and animals are beings who obviously behave, like robots, is theological and extreme, and, as I’m already starting to argue if you can feel it, racist. Ecological awareness is not about making other people feel stupid. It’s about realizing that because there’s at least one shadowy corner around which you’re not seeing, you yourself are always stupid. The shadows are infinite because we don’t know in advance how many there are, not because they go on forever. It’s all shadows. The dreams of dead people, waiting to be fulfilled by the living. All the entities that the poem gathers—African American humans, white people, cows and sheep and paper and pixels, all these beings coexist in ways that overlap. You could say for example that the human species is a heap of things such as humans and cows and computers and ideas about knitting and feudal monarchy and sand. And beaches are a heap of things such as sand and humans and waves and seaweed and so on. If you think of the world in terms of hyperobjects you are thinking of the world in terms of lots of gigantic overlapping things that are finite and fuzzy. Who wrote the poem is a heap of inconsistent things. When the poem was written is a heap of inconsistent times. And if you like ecological beings such as meadows and beaches and nice city streets with people being decent together, you had better believe in heaps. Logic, traditional vanilla Western logic that is, makes it almost impossible to believe in heaps. You can take bits out of a heap while still calling it a heap, until there’s nothing left, whereupon you realize that there must be no such things as heaps because look, here’s a whole lot of nothing and you were assuming there was a heap right up to that point. It’s called the Sorites paradox. Clouds, according to this, don’t really exist, because they’re made of little bits of cloud stuff; when you subtract the cloud stuff you get smaller and smaller bits of cloud stuff until there’s nothing—so there are no clouds, because clouds are vague. In the same way, you can argue that the Amazon jungle is just a gigantic feedlot waiting to happen, because if you take trees away there’s still a jungle, and you can keep on going till there’s just one tree, so jungles don’t really exist. But perhaps being vague is a criterion for existing. It certainly doesn’t seem easy to get rid of vague and downright contradictory things, without tying yourself in knots. Furthermore, you have to be a holist of some kind to be ecological. The trouble is, most forms of holism are exclusive and explosive. What do I mean? I mean that maybe we need to think that wholes are vague and messy and contradictory, not like Pan Man beings that eat up their contents and digest them totally. A cow could be part of one hyperobject—the human species thought in a non-essentialist way—and part of another one—the cow species for example, which in an expanded way also includes grass. The last time western philosophy tried to talk about all of whatever we are at once it got it very wrong and said “white man” all the time, like scratch the surface of any human and you’ll find a white man underneath. But humans caused global warming, not dolphins. We had better have an idea of who we are that is real and up to date and not racist or patriarchal. Thinking of ourselves as part of a vague heap of things that aren’t all to do with us exclusively, whoever we think we are, is a good place to start. There really are wholes, but they’re not your grandaddy’s whole, all perfect and fully integrated. Otherwise the whole called human is a totally different world from the world called moocows, and so we might get to thinking that we can do what we want with moocows or just totally ignore them. If we can’t overlap, we can’t communicate. If the concept of word means something self-contained and rigid, there’s no hope at all. And someone can say “My concept of world is much richer than yours, or you don’t have one at all, so I own Australia now.” I reckon this vacuum sealed world concept comes from rigid class hierarchies and I reckon that comes from demarcating the difference between human and nonhuman space using things like walls, because you have created granaries to preserve food from the ravages of mild global warming. You sealed off your human survival temporality, so you justify this by getting to think in various ways that the seal demarcates something real (religion, tragedy, philosophy, however you do it). It’s about 10 000 BCE, and you’re doing the right thing, at your scale, just like how starting your car in the morning doesn’t cause global warming. No, it really doesn’t. you’re not guilty. Besides, eating a bit less meat is much, much more effective than buying a Tesla, and easier too. You justify the demarcations and divisions of labor by explaining that the other classes must be different, really, really different beings altogether. And this is how racism begins to function. And it’s that internal human division that enables speciesism, the imagined difference between humans and everyone else. Think of that great diagram in robotics design, the Uncanny Valley. It explains racism while being racist in itself, so it’s very good to analyze, so we can come up with something else. On one side of the valley is a very suspicious being, the so-called “healthy human being,” and I think we can all hear the normal vs pathological, eugenics resonance in that concept. Exactly what is that, I don’t wonder for more than a second, speaking as we are close to Sacramento where in the early twentieth century horrible eugenics experiments were carried out, such as leaving newborn babies to die in hospital because they were unfit. On the other side of the valley is a cute so-called animal, or their electornic equivalent, the cute droid such as R2D2. They’re cute because they’re different—they’re separated by a thin hard line, which is what the Uncanny Valley looks like when you look across it at R2D2, because of foreshortening. Hitler was fond of his dog Blondi because Blondi was different enough from him, so that he could feel all those nice sublimated cute aggression feelings and make animal rights legislation. Let’s just face it—a lot of environmental organizations have had deep connections with white supremacy, and I’m explaining why. The Uncanny Valley diagram was created because it became well known in robotics that as you came closer and closer to imitating a lifelike human being, the robot passed through a phase that appeared strange or scary or creepy. The ultimate nadir of the Uncanny Valley is the zombie, the animated corpse who is a parody of the Cartesian self, just a body animated by some invisible force, moving in an automated way like the brooms in the Sorcerer’s Apprentice. According to hicks I overheard in rural Colorado (!), the zombie apocalypse is a pretty obviously racist concept about hordes of nonwhite people coming for your property, Barbara, and what’s awesome about many zombie works of art is how they subvert that. Anyway, the nice cute difference between me and R2D2 or Blondi the Alsatian is enabled by all the beings labeled as inhuman, subhuman and so on, beings that racism has chucked into the Uncanny Valley. Speciesism—the rigid difference between a human and a nonhuman—is enabled by racism—the machinery that categorizes some beings as inhuman or subhuman. Until you find out that you are in fact Neanderthals in some way, you tell yourself that they are uncanny failed versions of humans who just behaved like zombies, unlike us who have imagination and can see round corners and figure out how to make the zombies go extinct by slaughtering them all. So the way out of the Valley is actually not to get rid of the uncanny, which would make everything into a cute little machine coexisting in some fascist medium, we are all Earthlings or whatever, but actually the way out is to jump into the Valley, to realize that we ourselves are uncanny beings, that being a lifeform at all is being uncanny, because you are strangely strange all the way down. Because you are a symbiotic product of a truly random series of mutations called evolution. Which means that there is no Valley, because there is no healthy human being or perfect cute R2D2. Ecological awareness is like realizing you are on a gigantic flat plain on which exist all kinds of hazy weird beings whose status as alive or not alive, sentient or not sentient, conscious or not conscious (and even existing or not-existing) is not settled, but disturbed at every point. Again, ecological awareness doesn’t mean you stuck your head in a tree and forgot all your problems. It means you allowed yourself to be more haunted than ever, and in particular, that founding religious difference between act and behave that gives you humans versus everything else, imagination versus computing, let there be light versus being a slave, and all that toxic stuff, that act/behave boundary is not erased so that everything is a machine (which means there is still a perfume of act versus behave going on somewhere), but that everything is profoundly ambiguous. You can’t tell whether I am an android or not, and that’s what makes you treat me like a person. You don’t have to prove that rocks are definitely alive, you just have to notice that “alive” or “conscious” means I’m paranoid that you might be a zombie. Coexisting in symbiosis means you might have swallowed poison, and you did—it’s called being alive, which kills you in the end. There was no true difference between you and the cats and the vultures. The difference was enabled by difference between yourself and other humans. So what is the basic tone of a reality in which being haunted is the basic background to everything? This is the same as the reality in which the possibility that you might have poisoned yourself by eating that berry happens. The wondering whether you have been poisoned is the internal version of wondering what is around that corner. What do we call that tone? Well, it’s great, because we name it after the Greek for everything. We call it Panic. The Great God Pan and the Pan quality, which we call panic. Panic then really means everythingness, the realization that everything is happening. But everything-feel isn’t a lovely total thing. Everything means that there are so many incommensurate levels, so many shadows, so many specters. I like the word panic here because it also suggests a kind of quivering movement. Panic isn’t static—it tends to rush around or at least shiver on its own somewhere. We are beginning to notice that true fullness in the end is movement, always expanding, expansiveness…fullness of being isn’t some static thing to be achieved, but a dynamic process. Marx says it’s really like how production is actually the same as consumption, which by the way is the best way to start thinking about Marxist readings of poems, not as reflections of the freakin economy in which they were supposedly written. Plucking an apricot and putting it to your nose so you can smell that rose scent just after it’s fallen off a tree, then putting it in your mouth, chewing, swallowing…all that stuff is production. If that doesn’t speak volumes about the ways “act” and “behave” or “suffer” or “experience” have been violently severed and with violent consequences, I don’t know what would. Even in Marx—sorry to the Hegelian Marxist in Langston Hughes—produce doesn’t mean “let there be light” or pulling a rabbit out of a hat. It means something much more like “appreciate” or even “consume.” In one letter, Marx says that humans begin by production, “that is,” he says immediately, “by eating and drinking.” To eat or drink something you have to go along with it. If you’re a single celled organism, you have to envelop it…gulp! OMG did I just swallow poison? Again, this is the default phenomenology of symbiosis, a radical hospitality, giving rise to the possibility that the guest we let in might destroy us. To sag is to sink or subside gradually…think about how all the stuff that might happen to the dream has a really different temporality to it. Rotting is what happens to a corpse and one can’t help but visualize the history of lynching and the song “Strange Fruit.” Becoming glazed with sugar might take longer than rotting, if we were thinking about an item of food. Sagging has to do with just persisting but without being used by us. And exploding might be the sudden catastrophe that results when sagging has gone on for a while, or glazing, or rotting. (**) What we are experiencing in this poem is discarded, unutilized pleasure. What is wrong with society, according to this logic, is not that there is too much pleasure in capitalism or consumerism. It’s that there’s not enough. Look—you just chucked that carton of juice away and you hadn’t even finished it. Now we have to get in the car and go to the water park, and you’ll be thirsty. It’s hard perhaps to deal with, in an ecology talk, in a country whose growth in the nineteenth century was a way to enact the fantasies of working class European immigrants, so that when you walk down Main Street, you are walking inside their heads—the heads that imagine what those rich posh people must be eating while you’re starving on potatoes: all the meat and white bread they must be eating, eventually turned into easy to handle hamburgers, the Land of Cockaygne “All you can eat,” big gulp fantasy that has done a great job so far of almost destroying Earth, America, the biggest pile of Europe ever—a place where by the side of the road you might find a gigantic shoe not made by Claes Oldenburg but by some local guy, the biggest this, the most amount of that, eventually requiring feedlots and planet death. It’s hard to swallow for us eco people, brought up on the necessity—and let’s face it the stylistic distinction—of being abstemious. It’s hard to swallow that what ecological politics might be about is more pleasure and not less, and that thus in consumerism there is a distorted not fully nice version of the kind of pleasure we might expect if, say, keeping polar bears or coral alive was higher up on our agenda. But that’s exactly the imagery in this poem—if you don’t try to enact it, the dream could rot or bloom with sugar or sag and explode, scattering its possibilities and causing unintended damage—and I suggest that since it’s a key, major part of the poetics of anti-racism and the struggle of African American people, and since this struggle is key to an ecological politics, we shouldn’t ignore that imagery. The poem is talking about interpretation, in lots of ways. The dream deferred is, as I pointed out earlier, the full meaning of the poem, which haunts the sentences like a shadow from the future. Dreams are like that, says Freud: they are infinitely interpretable. But what does infinity mean? If you try to count up to it, you won’t be able to, so the idea that it means “going on and on forever” is a dangerous illusion, an ideological one I would argue. Infinity means you can’t count it. There might be three of whatever it is, but you can’t know that in advance. There might be twenty million, but a thing stops somewhere. Interpretation stops somewhere. Alan Turing had to invent the idea of computers to prove that things stop somewhere. You can’t make a program powerful enough to predict when every other program will go into an infinite loop. Turing was trying to prove Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem. A logical system must be flawed in order to exist so you can make it go into an infinite loop. And you can’t design an uber meta program that can predict (aka the future…) when any other algorithm will go into an infinite loop…which means that the future is open, like how poems are, because there must always be some opacity in a logical system in order for it to be transparent, or true. Godel created his theorem because about Russell and Whitehead were trying to police mathematician Cantor (a mathematician like Godel), police him with logic. Cantor discovered infinities that were ‘bigger” than regular. And infinity truly means you can’t count (compute) it, not it goes on forever…in between Hilbert was wondering whether computational processes could be seen to stop (the Entscheidungsproblem)…it’s like they invented computers to prove that computers can’t do everything…and then the Max 8 showed up… And in parallel this war between logic and math halfway through the twentieth century, like “Harlem,” like the Golden Spike in global warming data that scientists point to in 1945, this war between logic and math is about Tarski inventing the idea of metalanguage to police sentences like “this sentence is false”—you can always invent a sentence that will blow up the rule…like how Lacan says there is no metalanguage… The infinite openness of futurality is what the essence of a thing is, as opposed to its appearance, which is if you think about it the past. Automated systems such as economies or programs that make planes crash are past states of thought and feeling encoded in rules, customs, habits, lines of code. The trouble with automation is not artificial intelligence—heaven knows I may be an android. The trouble with automation is that the past is eating the future. Automation, if the past sucked, and generally it does, can you tell?—means alienation. Openness and finitude thus go together. Another way of saying what the mathematicians are saying against the western logicians, is that there’s at least one level on which you or your interpretation or your action, whatever it may be, suck(s). Some lifeform you didn’t think about gets killed or eventually you get cancer because you ate too many of whatever in whatever particular way. Ecological awareness, meaning you realize things happen on lots of space and time scales at once, means knowing that at some point at least you are a hypocrite. You can’t get it perfect. Not knowing when an entity wil come to an end is thus part of panic, the basic ecological mood, the great god Pan. You that a thing is flawed, that it will stop, but you can’t know exactly when or how, at least not for everything. Will mass extinction wipe us out, and when? It’s like that. It’s a good time to panic and think and do something about it. Sugar is a thing that evokes both Nature and culture, civilization and barbarism, pleasure and slavery. And in Hughes’s poem, a sugary death is only one way of thinking about the dream. The poem explodes the difference between coating a thing with sugar and letting that thing glaze itself—culture and nature. Nature and culture both now explode in the face of ecological awareness, evaporating in the face of what I like to call the symbiotic real—the fact of being in a biosphere where exorbitant and always risky mutual aid is in effect everywhere. The blankness of the page is the automated zombie apocalypse—it’s whiteness eating your brain with memes, stopping you from thinking, obtruding on the dream like a huge hot parking lot surrounding a carton of orange juice. Sagging suggests just letting gravity, aka spacetime, do its thing, a kind of existing in indifference. It’s not about stasis--it’s moving. Sagging is an abject movement that could indeed explode from the inside as slime as much as fire, like ectoplasm, the spectral body fluid; sagging is about physical being and time, “going out of shape” and getting old…Environmental creepiness is there in that racist southern gothic mood, half detected in “Harlem” and fully there in “Strange Fruit,” the weight of the past sagging or weighing like a nightmare. The futurality of things (the dream deferred) could sag in the toxic atmosphere of automation…the plane that can’t crash, the ship that can’t sink—didn’t we learn anything from the Titanic or from Titanic? Leonardo di Caprio would be pulped in a malfunctioning Max 8, that massively distributed Titanic. You can’t even make a romantic film about it. Is that progress?","@context":"http://schema.org"}</script>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The idea that alienation is being cut off from the future, the possibility that things might be different, has become very easy to think, and very good to think. All this has some consequences for art.”</p>

<p style="line-height: 2;">
<br /><br />
<span style="font-size: 5em; font-weight: 500;display:inline-block">“</span>Most ecological and plenty of non-ecological theories of alienation exist. Most of them state that we are alienated from a past where things were better, or perfect. But this is just the notion of the Fall, translated into some other mode, and that narrative is one way in which agricultural societies talk about the damage they have already done. The inherent speciesism (“nature” versus human culture) of this model is historically bankrolled by racism and patriarchy.
There’s another way of thinking about alienation, logically, and luckily there are ways of showing that it’s true: if we aren’t alienated from the past we are alienated from the future.
The media tell us that we are approaching the end of the world, because of global warming, but it’s much more serious than that. We are approaching us being dead and children now growing up and having to live in this biosphere, for a long time—longer than the end of time, in any case. The idea that alienation is being cut off from the future, the possibility that things might be different, has become very easy to think, and very good to think.
<br /><br />
All this has some consequences for art.

This is a poem called “Harlem” and it’s by Langston Hughes. Let’s start to read it.
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">Okay, well who wrote this poem? Langston Hughes would be the easiest answer. But all kinds of author functions, as Foucault used to say, exist. Maybe it’s better to say “Who or what wrote the poem?” It’s quite common for example to reduce Marxist criticism to its vulgar version, where you square the poem with the economic conditions of the day, say about a decade, in the country in which it was written. That Tennyson poem is a typical product of 1840s industrial capitalism in Britain. This Hughes poem is a typical product of 1950s American capitalism. Or whatever.
<br />
</span>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
So who wrote the poem? A human being? The human being’s family or psychic issues? The human being’s unconscious? The culture the human lived in? How many do we include? Who wrote the poem? Capitalism? The human genome? The biosphere? The ecosystem around the human poet? A light fall of rain one morning? The climate? The nuclear industry? The military industrial complex? The structure of racism in mid-twentieth century America? The struggle of African Americans to achieve basic rights?
</span>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
You see the thing is, ecological awareness is all about beginning to realize that things are happening on all kinds of scales, all at once, and that these scales aren’t like how you encounter them in museums or online. You can’t toggle nicely and smoothly back and forth from the very small to the very large, from the micro to the macro. That micro macro talk is Neoplatonic medieval something or other anyway.
</span>
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
All right, let’s try something else. When was the poem written? The early twentieth century? The week Hughes put pen to paper? The month?  One year in his life? The time of modernity? The time of modernism? The time of post-Neolithic civilization? The time of humans on Earth?
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
In a way the poem was written in all of these times. Right? Just like in a way, all the beings I listed earlier wrote the poem.
</span>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
Let’s think about another aspect of the poem. Let’s think about the physical media of which it’s composed. Paper, typewriter ink; pixels, glass screens; microfilm. Roman Jakobson has a clunky but interesting six-part model of communication, that is useful in the way that all structuralist interpretative devices are useful, which is the way in which magic mixers that can slice and dice your food five different ways are useful. Put the poem through the blender, you learn something from what the blender does to it.
</span>
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
So the first thing you notice is, there are these spacious gaps between some of the lines, while some other lines are close together. The first line, “What happens to a dream deferred?” has a lot of space around it—it’s trying to make you think, but it’s also trying to make you feel something, the opaque weight of all that deferment. It’s a tight little poem, whose lines have two or three rhythmical feet, and that means that unlike a wall of words, the space around the poem and between the stanzas is highlighted and becomes part of how you read it—you have to find some way to pronounce the blankness at the end of each line. In a way the poem a little bit lonely, like discarded little carton of orange juice that you find one day lying in an empty parking lot—not enough people are noticing what it’s saying. Or, conversely, the poem is trapped in a bath of blankness, pressing in on all sides—if you think about the parking lot the same way, it’s the same thing. something huge and constructed and blank yet weirdly invisible because it’s so hard to see presses in on our powers of thought and our physical powers on all sides. Your feet ache and you feel lonely and you regret the absence of butterflies.
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
(The poem isn’t going to tell you. Poems let themselves be opaque altogether, like that parking lot, or we let them, or both. That means that poems are a place where what I like to call the future future gathers—the radical freshness that enables the possibility that things might be different, rather than the one we can build out from where we are now, using prediction and extrapolation. Again, my point is that we are alienated from the future, not from the past. we aren’t trying to recover an Edenic meaning that the poet somehow hid in there like a message in a bottle. We’re trying to assess the scope and awesomeness of this particular futural gateway.)
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
The weight  of deferment—the weight of waiting, as a matter of fact—is legible in the way the poem organizes the medium in which it has been inscribed—the so called “space” is actually the obtruding presence of the physical medium in which the poem exists. Say it’s on paper, well in that case, there’s a lot of pulp, trees, water, sunlight, all the things that make trees that make paper, in that pause. It’s not nothing. It’s not silence, as John Cage would have said—silence is just the way socially determined sounds taper off and you get to hear something else.
</span>
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
It’s something I love about the Laser Interferometry Gravitational Observatory, about two miles north west of New Orleans, which is sort of Houston’s sister city. Two laser beams at right angles. It’s a very simple and relatively cheap experiment, compared at any rate with CERN. It’s tens of millions rather than billions, and there’s a difference, although it may seem absurdly expensive to us. At LIGO, these two lasers are bouncing off carefully calibrated mirrors. They pick up everything. Everything. Like cattle walking over the cattle grid in the field outside. People having arguments in an adjoining room about the experiment. Cars going past on the road outside. And you know what’s most uncanny is, if you know the waveforms for these things, you can subtract them from the waveform that results from the vibrating lasers. The movement of tectonic plates; the sound of aircraft…the lasers pick up everything, and when you cut out those cows walking over the grid and so on (I love the cows part), and there’s a tiny squiggle of something left, that you can’t explain, and it has the right sort of anticipated shape, do you know what is? That thing is a gravity wave.
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
It’s a signature of two black holes colliding, one thousand light years away, a tiny flicker of spacetime in which everything on Earth got a little bit smaller and a little bit slower-living, then a little bit bigger and a little bit faster, then back to normal. Half an hour after the new improved LIGO was switched on, with more carefully calibrated lasers, two black holes collided and the energy equaled the output of the entire universe. And a ripple in spacetime spread out until it passed through everything on Earth. Is it not uncanny—rather like the idea of shadowtime that I was hearing about yesterday evening—that the gravity wave was right there, inside the waveform determined by moocows, cars, people arguing, tectonic plates…
</span>
<br /><br />
<d style="padding-left: 100px;display:block">Does [the dream deferred] stink like rotten meat?</d>
<d style="padding-left: 100px;display:block">Or crust and sugar over—</d>
<d style="padding-left: 100px;display:block">like a syrupy sweet?</d>
<br />
<d style="padding-left: 100px;display:block">Maybe it just sags</d>
<d style="padding-left: 100px;display:block">like a heavy load.</d>
<br />
<d style="padding-left: 100px;display:block">Or does it explode?</d>
<br /><br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
Then you realize that the shadowtime is also in the imagery. The rotting of meat—the way it becomes inedible for humans because it’s being eaten by bacteria—the rotting is commensurate, in a metaphorical sense, with the deferment of the dream of un-alienated fullness of being, the “dream” that Hughes is talking about. It’s an ecological process—the appropriation of something we thought was just for us (it’s called “meat” not “cows” or “pigs” for this reason), by something else. The something else-ness is what makes the rottenness of the meat disgusting. That’s a thing that can happen in a few days in your kitchen; the racism is a thing that can happen for several hundred years in the hemisphere you live in on Earth. Metaphor is bringing these two timescales close without collapsing them into one another. “This is that,” in the realm of metaphor rather than math, means also that “this is not that.” Rotting time is not the same as dream deferment time.
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
Then there’s the “crust”-ing and the “sugar”-ing over. Perhaps Hughes means that the dream becomes a candified, plastic, purely aesthetic version of itself, easy to understand but impossible to act out, because it’s been reduced to a commodified consumer object. Given the long history of slavery and sugar, this is a potent image indeed. The Romantic poets Coleridge and Southey argued for boycotting sugar in the mid 1790s, arguing that sugar was an extreme metaphor or catachresis: sugar is the crystallized blood of slaves. The implication in the image is that the sugar coating would be a symptom of continuing slavery. If sugar is alienated slave labor, a sugar-coated dream is an alienated one that you can’t realize, only appreciate.
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
The sick part of the sugaring is that the dream might do it to itself, like how chocolate starts to separate and the ingredients rise and sink, something we call chocolate bloom. The sweetness of the dream might rise to the surface, encrust it and make it impossible to live it. The oppressive forces are installed inside of the dream, because the dream is in relation to them, and is born within them. And in an ecological context, if, as I believe, destroying racism would be tantamount to undoing a gigantic amount of the ideologies that sever us from other lifeforms, a severing actively and automatically pursued for thousands of years in what is called civilization, the response to the mid global warming of the Holocene—if destroying racism means that, then “Harlem” is talking obliquely about an ecological politics.
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
Let’s talk about that for a moment—what I mean by that. Economics isn’t about dollars and interest rates. Dollars and interest rates aren’t about dollars and interest rates. All that stuff is reified capitalist theology, aka economics 101 in non-communist universities. Economics is how you organize your enjoyment, how you organize how stuff flows around in your house, your home, your world, all the shit that you have going on.
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
And ecology is how the house, the home, the world that you’ve got going works, the logic of it. Economics and ecology are intertwined, etymologically, logically, socially, everything. So the question is, do these things pertain only to human beings? Do you have cockroaches and rats in or around your home? Do you look after a cat, and is it your house the cat lives in? Since I leave the house a lot more than the cat, in many ways it’s the cat’s house more than mine. This is sort of related to how, when I became a dad, I had that this is not my beautiful house feeling, very quickly, as Claire began to make it very clear that it was her house, not mine—psychologically that’s very true, isn’t it, your parents’ house that you grew up in was much more yours than theirs, it was the first world you lived in. They just happened to rent or buy or whatever another living space in a series.
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
And related to this question, another question of pleasure. If we don’t like the theology of dollars and structural unemployment and having to work to live and all that stuff—if we think we are a bit socialist or Marxist or anarcho-communist whatever—do we think it would be a good idea to include cockroaches and cats in the revolutionary projects we have going on to transmogrify our homes, our worlds, into things that are more pleasurable for the beings who have stuff going on, like trying to find out where the rats really live in my cat’s case, or trying to write a lecture when you’re feeling really depressed about ecological politics and mass extinction in my case, etc?
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
From a utilitarian point of view—which I find deeply problematic but whatever let’s use it, because it’s pretty default in our world—just existing is a form of pleasure. So if there are more revolutionary beings, like hedgehogs with little Che Guevara caps and stuff, that means more pleasure, so involving more lifeforms in revolutionary struggles would be better. Thanks very much for listening, my name is Tim Morton and if you have any questions I’ll be available afterwards.
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
Right. So let’s go back to the poem. There’s the stuff about the dream rotting or glazing itself with sugar. I like very much how the dream immediately is a physical thing, something lying around in the sun. Then there’s another gap, and the idea that the dream might just continue, in an abject sort of way, “sagging” “Like a heavy load”—the dream itself has lost its utopian dreamlike lightness and has itself become one of the things that hangs over your head.
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
In writing this poem, the authors (for Langston Hughes is one of them, but there are many that his work brings into alignment) seem to be observing that a whole complex range of timescales and histories are felt in the deferment of the dream, whose lingering potency is present in its absence in the way the poem organizes the blank space around it.
</span>

<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
But the blank space isn’t blank. The poem obviously plays with topics such as rotting and producing sugars, or being coated by sugars, processes that are to do with the biochemistry of lifeforms in a biosphere. The gaps in the poem mean that something there, but what is there? The open question quality is legible in the opacity of those gaps. What is there quite literally is the paper or the pixels, and what is there definitely and more figuratively is the labor of black people—what Karl Marx would call the species being of humans. Marx identifies this with imaginative projection and appropriation, but we don’t have to. Let’s just focus on the brute, aka silent, presence of physical being in those gaps, a physical being whose analog are the concrete images of rotting, sugaring and exploding.
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
What is this physical being? The work of slaves, thought in typical western philosophy as a machinic functioning, like the behavior of an algorithm. Slavery articulates the anthropocentric differences between humans and so-called animals: humans, like slave owners, act, while animals, like slaves, merely behave. You can see immediately that the ways we have of talking about this stuff are deeply contaminated by speciesism, and that this has to do with racism, and I’m going to try to sort out exactly how in this talk. Because blank space isn’t just blank, and because the physical medium the poem appears in doesn’t just function smoothly in the background. That’s the whole point—the obtrusion of the paper or pixels into the poem itself is a kind of malfunction, like rotting or sugaring or sagging, and perhaps like exploding: that’s the question the poem poses altogether—is the exploding an error? We know it’s the logical consequence, within the poem, of continuing oppression. But does “explode” mean “explode into life and therefore become dangerous to the white powers that be” or does “explode” mean “evaporate as if it had never existed at all”?
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
The blank space is and isn’t the poem. It’s a place where the poem malfunctions or rather, a place where the poem reveals that one being’s functioning is another being’s malfunction, and more deeply, how lines of poetry and spaces between them and everything else are all a series of malfunctions, such that smoothness is an illusion. Indeed, the deferment and the supposed silence are symptoms of a massive malfunction, in the fully “evil” sense of “mal” as the first syllables of that word. An evil functioning is what is detected in the gaps in the poem, the persistence of a state that has indeed been naturalized—the relations between white and black people—but which is anything but natural; or rather, the smoothness of its supposed naturalness is in fact a symptom of horrific violence, like the peaceful atmosphere after a tornado or bomb test.
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
And isn’t that ecological awareness in a nutshell, really? The fact that since there is always an environment—some kind of opacity, some kind of surrounding something in which things are taking place—that the silence and absence isn’t to do with the reader being stupid or evil. Environmental awareness isn’t about being smarter or wiser than the average person. It’s just how awareness in general is, that it always takes place against some kind of taken for granted structure or background or set of assumptions or rows of beehives or vineyards or sugar plantations…there’s always a shadow side, always a shadowtime—it’s not that if you’re truly ecological there are no shadows. It’s that there are more. You are more haunted than you were.
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
Ecological awareness most certainly is not about seeing things more clearly than Joe Public. Ecological awareness is about being willing to be haunted. We’ll see quite soon just how hard wired into ecology are concepts of specters, ghosts, shadows, fleeting things that appear in the corner of your eye. Ecologica awareness doesn’t mean you exorcised the bad artificial stuff and got back to nature. It mean that a greater number than ever of opaque semi-silent shadowy beings are making soft noises in the margins...it’s something that is powerfully conveyed in Amiri Baraka’s “Something in the Way of Things,” a poem whose paranoid tone aims to delineate the spooky, spectral presence of brutality and exploitation and racism in the fabric of the seemingly quiet street along which the narrator is walking.
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
Paranoia is the default, ground state version of empathy—the more paranoid I am about you, are you really a robot or not, is the way I become more and more interested in you as a person. This whole idea that people are beings who obviously act and animals are beings who obviously behave, like robots, is theological and extreme, and, as I’m already starting to argue if you can feel it, racist. Ecological awareness is not about making other people feel stupid. It’s about realizing that because there’s at least one shadowy corner around which you’re not seeing, you yourself are always stupid.
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
The shadows are infinite because we don’t know in advance how many there are, not because they go on forever. It’s all shadows. The dreams of dead people, waiting to be fulfilled by the living. All the entities that the poem gathers—African American humans, white people, cows and sheep and paper and pixels, all these beings coexist in ways that overlap. You could say for example that the human species is a heap of things such as humans and cows and computers and ideas about knitting and feudal monarchy and sand. And beaches are a heap of things such as sand and humans and waves and seaweed and so on. If you think of the world in terms of hyperobjects you are thinking of the world in terms of lots of gigantic overlapping things that are finite and fuzzy. Who wrote the poem is a heap of inconsistent things. When the poem was written is a heap of inconsistent times.
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
And if you like ecological beings such as meadows and beaches and nice city streets with people being decent together, you had better believe in heaps. Logic, traditional vanilla Western logic that is, makes it almost impossible to believe in heaps. You can take bits out of a heap while still calling it a heap, until there’s nothing left, whereupon you realize that there must be no such things as heaps because look, here’s a whole lot of nothing and you were assuming there was a heap right up to that point. It’s called the Sorites paradox. Clouds, according to this, don’t really exist, because they’re made of little bits of cloud stuff; when you subtract the cloud stuff you get smaller and smaller bits of cloud stuff until there’s nothing—so there are no clouds, because clouds are vague. In the same way, you can argue that the Amazon jungle is just a gigantic feedlot waiting to happen, because if you take trees away there’s still a jungle, and you can keep on going till there’s just one tree, so jungles don’t really exist.
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
But perhaps being vague is a criterion for existing. It certainly doesn’t seem easy to get rid of vague and downright contradictory things, without tying yourself in knots. Furthermore, you have to be a holist of some kind to be ecological. The trouble is, most forms of holism are exclusive and explosive. What do I mean? I mean that maybe we need to think that wholes are vague and messy and contradictory, not like Pan Man beings that eat up their contents and digest them totally. A cow could be part of one hyperobject—the human species thought in a non-essentialist way—and part of another one—the cow species for example, which in an expanded way also includes grass.
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
The last time western philosophy tried to talk about all of whatever we are at once it got it very wrong and said “white man” all the time, like scratch the surface of any human and you’ll find a white man underneath. But humans caused global warming, not dolphins. We had better have an idea of who we are that is real and up to date and not racist or patriarchal. Thinking of ourselves as part of a vague heap of things that aren’t all to do with us exclusively, whoever we think we are, is a good place to start. There really are wholes, but they’re not your grandaddy’s whole, all perfect and fully integrated.
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
Otherwise the whole called human is a totally different world from the world called moocows, and so we might get to thinking that we can do what we want with moocows or just totally ignore them. If we can’t overlap, we can’t communicate. If the concept of word means something self-contained and rigid, there’s no hope at all. And someone can say “My concept of world is much richer than yours, or you don’t have one at all, so I own Australia now.”
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
I reckon this vacuum sealed world concept comes from rigid class hierarchies and I reckon that comes from demarcating the difference between human and nonhuman space using things like walls, because you have created granaries to preserve food from the ravages of mild global warming. You sealed off your human survival temporality, so you justify this by getting to think in various ways that the seal demarcates something real (religion, tragedy, philosophy, however you do it). It’s about 10 000 BCE, and you’re doing the right thing, at your scale, just like how starting your car in the morning doesn’t cause global warming. No, it really doesn’t. you’re not guilty. Besides, eating a bit less meat is much, much more effective than buying a Tesla, and easier too.
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
You justify the demarcations and divisions of labor by explaining that the other classes must be different, really, really different beings altogether. And this is how racism begins to function. And it’s that internal human division that enables speciesism, the imagined difference between humans and everyone else. Think of that great diagram in robotics design, the Uncanny Valley. It explains racism while being racist in itself, so it’s very good to analyze, so we can come up with something else.
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
On one side of the valley is a very suspicious being, the so-called “healthy human being,” and I think we can all hear the normal vs pathological, eugenics resonance in that concept. Exactly what is that, I don’t wonder for more than a second, speaking as we are close to Sacramento where in the early twentieth century horrible eugenics experiments were carried out, such as leaving newborn babies to die in hospital because they were unfit. On the other side of the valley is a cute so-called animal, or their electornic equivalent, the cute droid such as R2D2. They’re cute because they’re different—they’re separated by a thin hard line, which is what the Uncanny Valley looks like when you look across it at R2D2, because of foreshortening. Hitler was fond of his dog Blondi because Blondi was different enough from him, so that he could feel all those nice sublimated cute aggression feelings and make animal rights legislation. Let’s just face it—a lot of environmental organizations have had deep connections with white supremacy, and I’m explaining why.
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
The Uncanny Valley diagram was created because it became well known in robotics that as you came closer and closer to imitating a lifelike human being, the robot passed through a phase that appeared strange or scary or creepy. The ultimate nadir of the Uncanny Valley is the zombie, the animated corpse who is a parody of the Cartesian self, just a body animated by some invisible force, moving in an automated way like the brooms in the Sorcerer’s Apprentice. According to hicks I overheard in rural Colorado (!), the zombie apocalypse is a pretty obviously racist concept about hordes of nonwhite people coming for your property, Barbara, and what’s awesome about many zombie works of art is how they subvert that.
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
Anyway, the nice cute difference between me and R2D2 or Blondi the Alsatian is enabled by all the beings labeled as inhuman, subhuman and so on, beings that racism has chucked into the Uncanny Valley. Speciesism—the rigid difference between a human and a nonhuman—is enabled by racism—the machinery that categorizes some beings as inhuman or subhuman. Until you find out that you are in fact Neanderthals in some way, you tell yourself that they are uncanny failed versions of humans who just behaved like zombies, unlike us who have imagination and can see round corners and figure out how to make the zombies go extinct by slaughtering them all. So the way out of the Valley is actually not to get rid of the uncanny, which would make everything into a cute little machine coexisting in some fascist medium, we are all Earthlings or whatever, but actually the way out is to jump into the Valley, to realize that we ourselves are uncanny beings, that being a lifeform at all is being uncanny, because you are strangely strange all the way down. Because you are a symbiotic product of a truly random series of mutations called evolution. Which means that there is no Valley, because there is no healthy human being or perfect cute R2D2. Ecological awareness is like realizing you are on a gigantic flat plain on which exist all kinds of hazy weird beings whose status as alive or not alive, sentient or not sentient, conscious or not conscious (and even existing or not-existing) is not settled, but disturbed at every point. Again, ecological awareness doesn’t mean you stuck your head in a tree and forgot all your problems. It means you allowed yourself to be more haunted than ever, and in particular, that founding religious difference between act and behave that gives you humans versus everything else, imagination versus computing, let there be light versus being a slave, and all that toxic stuff, that act/behave boundary is not erased so that everything is a machine (which means there is still a perfume of act versus behave going on somewhere), but that everything is profoundly ambiguous. You can’t tell whether I am an android or not, and that’s what makes you treat me like a person. You don’t have to prove that rocks are definitely alive, you just have to notice that “alive” or “conscious” means I’m paranoid that you might be a zombie. Coexisting in symbiosis means you might have swallowed poison, and you did—it’s called being alive, which kills you in the end.
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
There was no true difference between you and the cats and the vultures. The difference was enabled by difference between yourself and other humans.
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
So what is the basic tone of a reality in which being haunted is the basic background to everything? This is the same as the reality in which the possibility that you might have poisoned yourself by eating that berry happens. The wondering whether you have been poisoned is the internal version of wondering what is around that corner. What do we call that tone? Well, it’s great, because we name it after the Greek for everything. We call it Panic. The Great God Pan and the Pan quality, which we call panic.
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
Panic then really means everythingness, the realization that everything is happening. But everything-feel isn’t a lovely total thing. Everything means that there are so many incommensurate levels, so many shadows, so many specters. I like the word panic here because it also suggests a kind of quivering movement. Panic isn’t static—it tends to rush around or at least shiver on its own somewhere.
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
We are beginning to notice that true fullness in the end is movement, always expanding, expansiveness…fullness of being isn’t some static thing to be achieved, but a dynamic process. Marx says it’s really like how production is actually the same as consumption, which by the way is the best way to start thinking about Marxist readings of poems, not as reflections of the freakin economy in which they were supposedly written. Plucking an apricot and putting it to your nose so you can smell that rose scent just after it’s fallen off a tree, then putting it in your mouth, chewing, swallowing…all that stuff is production. If that doesn’t speak volumes about the ways “act” and “behave” or “suffer” or “experience” have been violently severed and with violent consequences, I don’t know what would. Even in Marx—sorry to the Hegelian Marxist in Langston Hughes—produce doesn’t mean “let there be light” or pulling a rabbit out of a hat. It means something much more like “appreciate” or even “consume.” In one letter, Marx says that humans begin by production, “that is,” he says immediately, “by eating and drinking.” To eat or drink something you have to go along with it. If you’re a single celled organism, you have to envelop it…gulp! OMG did I just swallow poison? Again, this is the default phenomenology of symbiosis, a radical hospitality, giving rise to the possibility that the guest we let in might destroy us.
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
To sag is to sink or subside gradually…think about how all the stuff that might happen to the dream has a really different temporality to it. Rotting is what happens to a corpse and one can’t help but visualize the history of lynching and the song “Strange Fruit.” Becoming glazed with sugar might take longer than rotting, if we were thinking about an item of food. Sagging has to do with just persisting but without being used by us. And exploding might be the sudden catastrophe that results when sagging has gone on for a while, or glazing, or rotting. (**)
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
What we are experiencing in this poem is discarded, unutilized pleasure. What is wrong with society, according to this logic, is not that there is too much pleasure in capitalism or consumerism. It’s that there’s not enough. Look—you just chucked that carton of juice away and you hadn’t even finished it. Now we have to get in the car and go to the water park, and you’ll be thirsty. It’s hard perhaps to deal with, in an ecology talk, in a country whose growth in the nineteenth century was a way to enact the fantasies of working class European immigrants, so that when you walk down Main Street, you are walking inside their heads—the heads that imagine what those rich posh people must be eating while you’re starving on potatoes: all the meat and white bread they must be eating, eventually turned into easy to handle hamburgers, the Land of Cockaygne “All you can eat,” big gulp fantasy that has done a great job so far of almost destroying Earth, America, the biggest pile of Europe ever—a place where by the side of the road you might find a gigantic shoe not made by Claes Oldenburg but by some local guy, the biggest this, the most amount of that, eventually requiring feedlots and planet death.
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
It’s hard to swallow for us eco people, brought up on the necessity—and let’s face it the stylistic distinction—of being abstemious. It’s hard to swallow that what ecological politics might be about is more pleasure and not less, and that thus in consumerism there is a distorted not fully nice version of the kind of pleasure we might expect if, say, keeping polar bears or coral alive was higher up on our agenda. But that’s exactly the imagery in this poem—if you don’t try to enact it, the dream could rot or bloom with sugar or sag and explode, scattering its possibilities and causing unintended damage—and I suggest that since it’s a key, major part of the poetics of anti-racism and the struggle of African American people, and since this struggle is key to an ecological politics, we shouldn’t ignore that imagery.
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
The poem is talking about interpretation, in lots of ways. The dream deferred is, as I pointed out earlier, the full meaning of the poem, which haunts the sentences like a shadow from the future. Dreams are like that, says Freud: they are infinitely interpretable. But what does infinity mean? If you try to count up to it, you won’t be able to, so the idea that it means “going on and on forever” is a dangerous illusion, an ideological one I would argue. Infinity means you can’t count it. There might be three of whatever it is, but you can’t know that in advance. There might be twenty million, but a thing stops somewhere. Interpretation stops somewhere. Alan Turing had to invent the idea of computers to prove that things stop somewhere. You can’t make a program powerful enough to predict when every other program will go into an infinite loop.
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
Turing was trying to prove Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem. A logical system must be flawed in order to exist so you can make it go into an infinite loop. And you can’t design an uber meta program that can predict (aka the future…) when any other algorithm will go into an infinite loop…which means that the future is open, like how poems are, because there must always be some opacity in a logical system in order for it to be transparent, or true. Godel created his theorem because about Russell and Whitehead were trying to police mathematician Cantor (a mathematician like Godel), police him with logic. Cantor discovered infinities that were ‘bigger” than regular. And infinity truly means you can’t count (compute) it, not it goes on forever…in between Hilbert was wondering whether computational processes could be seen to stop (the Entscheidungsproblem)…it’s like they invented computers to prove that computers can’t do everything…and then the Max 8 showed up…
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
And in parallel this war between logic and math halfway through the twentieth century, like “Harlem,” like the Golden Spike in global warming data that scientists point to in 1945, this war between logic and math is about Tarski inventing the idea of metalanguage to police sentences like “this sentence is false”—you can always invent a sentence that will blow up the rule…like how Lacan says there is no metalanguage…
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
The infinite openness of futurality is what the essence of a thing is, as opposed to its appearance, which is if you think about it the past. Automated systems such as economies or programs that make planes crash are past states of thought and feeling encoded in rules, customs, habits, lines of code. The trouble with automation is not artificial intelligence—heaven knows I may be an android. The trouble with automation is that the past is eating the future. Automation, if the past sucked, and generally it does, can you tell?—means alienation.
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
Openness and finitude thus go together. Another way of saying what the mathematicians are saying against the western logicians, is that there’s at least one level on which you or your interpretation or your action, whatever it may be, suck(s). Some lifeform you didn’t think about gets killed or eventually you get cancer because you ate too many of whatever in whatever particular way. Ecological awareness, meaning you realize things happen on lots of space and time scales at once, means knowing that at some point at least you are a hypocrite. You can’t get it perfect. Not knowing when an entity wil come to an end is thus part of panic, the basic ecological mood, the great god Pan. You that a thing is flawed, that it will stop, but you can’t know exactly when or how, at least not for everything. Will mass extinction wipe us out, and when? It’s like that. It’s a good time to panic and think and do something about it.
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
Sugar is a thing that evokes both Nature and culture, civilization and barbarism, pleasure and slavery. And in Hughes’s poem, a sugary death is only one way of thinking about the dream. The poem explodes the difference between coating a thing with sugar and letting that thing glaze itself—culture and nature. Nature and culture both now explode in the face of ecological awareness, evaporating in the face of what I like to call the symbiotic real—the fact of being in a biosphere where exorbitant and always risky mutual aid is in effect everywhere. The blankness of the page is the automated zombie apocalypse—it’s whiteness eating your brain with memes, stopping you from thinking, obtruding on the dream like a huge hot parking lot surrounding a carton of orange juice.
</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
Sagging suggests just letting gravity, aka spacetime, do its thing, a kind of existing in indifference. It’s not about stasis--it’s moving. Sagging is an abject movement that could indeed explode from the inside as slime as much as fire, like ectoplasm, the spectral body fluid; sagging is about physical being and time, “going out of shape” and getting old…Environmental creepiness is there in that racist southern gothic mood, half detected in “Harlem” and fully there in “Strange Fruit,” the weight of the past sagging or weighing like a nightmare. The futurality of things (the dream deferred) could sag in the toxic atmosphere of automation…the plane that can’t crash, the ship that can’t sink—didn’t we learn anything from the Titanic or from Titanic? Leonardo di Caprio would be pulped in a malfunctioning Max 8, that massively distributed Titanic. You can’t even make a romantic film about it. Is that progress?
