<meta name="description" content="Adam Marcus directs Variable Projects, a design and research studio that operates at the intersection of architecture, computation, and fabrication. He is also a partner in Futures North, a public art collaborative dedicated to exploring the aesthetics of data. His work explores ways in which new technologies can interface with longstanding architectural traditions of craft, materiality, ornament, and pattern. Prior to founding his own practice, he worked at Marble Fairbanks in New York City as project architect for a number of award-winning educational and public projects. Projects include Buoyant Ecologies Float Lab, a prototype for a floating breakwater produced with collaborators at CCA’s Architectural Ecologies Lab, which recently won an R+D Award from Architectmagazine. Other work includes Centennial Chromagraph, a computationally-designed architectural installation which received a 2015 Small Project Award from the national chapter of AIA, and Meander, a permanent public artwork commissioned for CHS Field, a new baseball park in Saint Paul, Minnesota. At CCA he teaches design studios and courses in computational design and digital fabrication, co-directs CCA’s Architectural Ecologies Lab, and collaborates with CCA’s Digital Craft Lab.
