You lived underground, you came up once a year to to mate— in piggybacks and puddles. Smooth orange skin, halfway translucent. Sunny D poured into a mold. Indiscriminate acts to hurtle your species into the future. Possible to foil this extinction through propagation? No, the population’s the problem. Too many humans. Still not likely to go quietly— Brenda says it’s relaxation time— but not like that, not long now. Be the carbon and the green. No one there to identify their bones at the scene. Just no one there at all except sun, moon, woolly mammoth, and the moon’s moons, and probably roaches, rats, pigeons, and squirrels. Burrowing was supposed to be in one’s favor— unlike huddling together on land— but it comes for us all. Huddled together at the gay bar, parade, campus, theater, potluck, funeral. Oop Making it about them again. Golden toad last known mating episode 1987 year I was born Oop Golden toad Golden toad Thank you for returning your infinite matter to the biosphere." />

Tonight we think of you, golden toad— no longer with us on this plane, last seen 15 May 1989 in cloud forest and not a single one of you since. Decomposed? You lived underground, you
<br />
came
<br />
up once a year to to mate— in piggybacks and puddles. Smooth orange skin, halfway
translucent. Sunny D poured into a mold. Indiscriminate acts to hurtle your species into the future.
<br />
Possible
<br />
to foil this extinction through propagation? No, the population’s the problem. Too many humans. 
<br />
Still
<br />
not likely to go quietly— Brenda says it’s relaxation time— but not like that, not long now.
<br />
Be
<br />
the carbon and the green. No one there to identify their bones at the scene. Just no one there at all 
<br />
except
<br />
sun, moon, woolly mammoth, and the moon’s moons, and probably roaches, rats, pigeons, and squirrels.
