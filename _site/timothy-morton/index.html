<meta name="description" content="Rita Shea Guffey Chair in the Environmental Humanities Rice University In April 2019, the Architectural Ecologies Lab and the MFA Writing Program at California College of the Arts invited 48 guests to attend the first gathering of the ECOPOESIS Movement in San Francisco. Founded in 2018 by Christopher Falliers, Adam Marcus, and Leslie Carol Roberts, all CCA professors, the project explores ideas of how we talk about and message climate change – and more broadly ecologies. The goal was to generate collective, embodied messaging, which in turn would activate more conversations, and so on. Core to the project are “signal words,” all which begin with the letters “re-.” In April, the signal words were retreat, remain, resist, and the group was divided into three sections – with each taking one of the words for guidance. The guests were artists, writers, designers,journalists, graduate students, national park supervisors, academics from varied institutions, nonprofit administrators, selected for their varying lenses and expertise. Further focus was added by inviting Timothy Morton, author of Dark Ecologies and other ecological books, to serve as another reference point. An excerpt of Dark Ecologies was read by the group prior to the gathering. A cornerstone of ECOPOESIS is gathering at the table for food and conversation in an informal setting. One-and-a-half days and four meals later, the group presented their work and wrapped up with this public talk by Morton, who generously offered to 11.11 the chance to publish his remarks. Timothy Morton is Rita Shea Guffey Chair in English at Rice University. He has collaborated with Björk, Jennifer Walshe, Jeff Bridges, Olafur Eliasson, and Pharrell Williams. He co-wrote and appears in Living in the Future’s Past, a 2018 film about global warming with Jeff Bridges. He is the author of Being Ecological (Penguin, 2018), Humankind: Solidarity with Nonhuman People (Verso, 2017), Dark Ecology: For a Logic of Future Coexistence (Columbia, 2016), Nothing: Three Inquiries in Buddhism (Chicago, 2015), Hyperobjects: Philosophy and Ecology after the End of the World (Minnesota, 2013), Realist Magic: Objects, Ontology, Causality (Open Humanities, 2013), The Ecological Thought (Harvard, 2010), Ecology without Nature (Harvard, 2007), eight other books and 200 essays on philosophy, ecology, literature, music, art, architecture, design and food. His work has been translated into 10 languages. In 2014, Morton gave the Wellek Lectures in Theory." />
