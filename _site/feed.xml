&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Ye-ye always had a pocketful of White Rabbit candies for me when I was a child.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first time, I was three, maybe four. Ye-ye put a White Rabbit in the palm of his hand, then quickly closed both fists, shook both hands, and opened them. The candy was gone. Then he closed his fists and had me pick one.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I tapped a knuckle, and he smiled. He opened his hand and there lay the White Rabbit.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Who could resist? The white wrappers with the red and blue bands, the outline of the rabbit on the side. I untwisted the wrapper and found another piece of clear plastic around the white taffy, which I tried to peel off, but Ye-ye shook his head, and showed me how to put the candy on my tongue. Miracle of miracles, the &quot;plastic&quot; wrap began to melt. It was paper made from rice paste, and it dissolved like a communion wafer on my tongue, revealing the sweet taffy beneath. This was what love tasted like when I was three: like magic and sugar and pounded rice paste.
&lt;br /&gt;
My mother and father didn't want me to eat candy. They said candy would rot my teeth out. But eating White Rabbits was a religious experience for me now. There was no turning back.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ye-ye didn't have any teeth. He wore dentures, which he put in a glass beside his bed at night to soak. I saw them floating in the glass free of his mouth when he spent the summers with us in our house in Southern California after my brother, Nathan, was born. Nai-nai had died that spring, and my parents thought Ye-ye would be lonely. I also think they knew he would be willing to look after me for free. My mother was tense and tired and everything I did made her upset. I thought that would eventually change after the baby grew up a little bit, after the crying stopped, or grew less frequent.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The moment I woke up, I would sit up in my bed and wait for Ye-ye to come, the second earliest riser. He'd peek into my room, and I'd hold up my arms, and he'd come and pull me out of bed.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ye-ye took me for walks in the ancient stroller. The dew still glistened on the lawns, the air had a faint chill. He'd walk me to the corner and back, all by ourselves. We felt daring in the world.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This arrangement continued for years. Ye-ye coming for the summer, my brother taking all my mother's energy.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ye-ye and I only got lost once.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By then I was six, and Nathan had an earache. It seemed to last the entire summer. He cried all the time. Mama was irritable. Everything I did made her tense. Same old.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We began as we always had. Ye-ye and I walked hand-in-hand up the shaded sidewalks before the sun had risen high enough to burn the dew off and scorch the air. Then we went a little farther than usual, all the way to the corner, and then across that street, and up the block to the big house with gray turrets and large dense fruit trees. The owners were an elderly white couple and they had pomegranates. I'd gone on a fieldtrip for kindergarten and I remembered the way.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The nice couple had picked pomegranates from their trees and sliced them open and placed them on picnic tables covered with plastic red-and-white tablecloths. We'd all been given a quarter pomegranate to suck the seeds out of.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was morning and I was hungry, and who knew when my mother would get up and make breakfast anymore.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;I know a good place to go,&quot; I told Ye-ye, and we set off.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But when we got to the corner, I could see the house but it was nothing like the friendly welcoming home of my memory. The tall wrought-iron gates were not tied open with streamers; there were not lines of elementary school children on the lawn with paper plates in their hands. The house was dark, shadowed, the pomegranate trees overgrown, the shade dripping from the eaves and the leaf-laden branches menacing. Even the spiky turrets of the house, which had made it seem castle-like on the field trip, now appeared threatening, as though a witch not a princess might live inside.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I froze in place, Ye-ye's warm hand in mine.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A bird cawed overhead. Some kind of jay. It flew into the tree, then seemed caught in the sticky darkness. Its cawing turned distressful, a shriek.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I squeezed Ye-ye's hand. He patted my head.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ye-ye looked left and right. I knew he was wondering which way to go.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At first I couldn't move, then all at once, I knew we needed to run.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I pulled Ye-ye's hand and we turned, crossed to the sunny side of the street. I knew there was another way home. A way only in the sunshine.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There was a little girl, Karen, whose house I'd gone to for a birthday party. I could picture the house, white with blue shutters, and an orange tree in the lawn, a Big Wheel on the lawn. I felt certain we could reach it. I had walked to the house with Mama pushing Nathan's stroller.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We walked another block. Ye-ye followed me, patiently, trusting me.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The sun was moving higher in the sky, the shadows retreating, but I didn't feel safe yet from the inky shaded witchy house. We walked and walked. And then I was lost.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I knew we should turn. We turned and turned but what should have been our street, our house, our copse of avocado trees, was a different house, one with a chain-link fence and a large German shepherd with nicked ears staring through the wire. The dog barked, his harsh voice like electric volts to my heart.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ye-ye felt it, and gripped my hand too tightly, it hurt my fingers, and he pulled me along, but he couldn't walk very fast. Still he pulled me alongside him, and I didn't dare say Ouch, until we were out of range of the dog, a block and a turn away. We could hear the echo of his bark, but he was nowhere to be seen, and he surely couldn't see us either, I hoped.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We were truly lost then.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There was an old white man on a lawn chair in front of one of the houses. He wore shorts and an undershirt and his belly poked out from his shorts. He held a limp hose in one hand. Water trickled from its mouth.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There were patches of dirt on his lawn, and dandelions, the kind my father would not tolerate on ours. The moment a single one appeared, Papa would march out with his garden spade and his thick gloves and a plastic trash bag, and he'd dig the dandelion up, all the way to the root, and bag it, and tie the bag, and put it in the trash barrel before it could spread, he said. We were one of only a handful of Chinese families in our town in those days, and Papa felt it was important to show everyone that we understood the rules, that we knew how to keep our lawn nice, that we belonged.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The white man stared at us, and Ye-ye hesitated. I knew he was thinking we could ask the man for directions, but I didn't want to. I was afraid of the man. I prayed in my thoughts, Ye-ye, no, we can't stop here. Ever since I was very little, before I could talk, I knew if I thought hard enough, Ye-ye would hear me and understand.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No, Ye-ye, I prayed. We can't stop.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ye-ye understood, and we kept walking.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The sun was very high overhead, and it was hot. Ye-ye was wearing his long sleeved jacket, and he stopped and took it off, and folded it into half, and half again, and tucked it under his arm.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He took my right hand again in his left. My hand was hot and sticky and sweaty, but still he held me tightly.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We walked until Ye-ye suddenly had to stop on some stranger's lawn. He led me to a large shade tree, and he leaned his hand against the trunk. He took out his white handkerchief and wiped his face, and neck, and then the top of his head.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We were standing on the grass, which white people would not like. I knew from experience when my best friend, Gabby Ocampo, and I ran across the mean neighbor's lawn next to Gabby's house, and the old white woman had run out and shouted, &quot;You brats get off my lawn!&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ye-ye sat down on the lawn and patted the grass so that I would sit next to him. I was afraid we were going to get in trouble; there were white people in the house, looking at us through a crack in the curtains of their front window. I saw them flickering there, the curtains rippling, back and forth. But I obeyed and sat on the grass.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ye-ye reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a handful of very melted White Rabbits.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ye-ye's eyes twinkled as we both sucked on our candies, resisting the urge to chew, him because it was bad for his dentures, me out of solidarity. Except at the last minute when I absolutely couldn't stand it and I had to chomp on the candy until it was gone.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then like magic, Papa and Mama drove by in our Buick. They were driving slowly, all the windows down, and I saw them, and jumped up and ran towards them.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mama shouted, &quot;Ning-ning, don't run into the street!&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And I froze in place.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Papa parked the car right there in the middle of the street. He jumped out of the driver's side, and I thought, We are saved!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then he ran over to me, and swatted me on the ass, once, twice, three times. &quot;Bad girl!&quot; he said. And swatted me again.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was too old for this. It wasn't the pain that made me grimace and fight back my tears as I stood there on the sidewalk in front of Ye-ye, in front of the white family who were watching from behind the curtains of their picture window. The indignity.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Papa dragged me by the arm to the car. He opened the back door and said, &quot;Get in!&quot; Then he pushed me inside and I sat down, even though the hot vinyl burned the back of my legs.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then Papa went to get Ye-ye, and he helped him up slowly, and he took his arm, and walked him to the other side of the car.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mama said, &quot;Poor Ye-ye. Oh, poor Ye-ye. He could have had a stroke in this heat.&quot; Nathan was on her lap and he started to whimper.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ye-ye said something to Papa in Chinese that I couldn't understand and Papa said something in Chinese back, only very loudly, and over and over.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then Mama said, &quot;Ning-ning, what were you thinking?&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That's how it was, ever since Nathan was born. I was blamed for every thing that went wrong. His illness, his crying all the time, his having to go to the hospital, all the tests, all the doctors.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Ning-ning, I'm ashamed of you. You know you're not supposed to leave the house alone. What has gotten into you?&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And I thought like saying, But I wasn't alone. I was with Ye-ye. But I didn't say it. Which turned out to be a good thing, because the next thing Mama said was, &quot;You could have gotten Ye-ye killed. You're lucky we found you.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And that's when I cried for real, tears and snot and shame, in front of everyone.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After that, my parents became fearful. I wasn't allowed to go out by myself, and I wasn't allowed to go on walks with Ye-ye.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;He's forgetful. He's not himself. You're too much for him.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The next year, Ye-ye didn't come for the summer at all. He stayed in his apartment in New York City with my uncle. In fact, he wouldn't visit again in person ever. Traveling had become too hard for him.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, he continued to send me White Rabbits in a box for my birthday and New Year's, along with a red envelope, every year until he died when I was eleven.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I didn't have White Rabbits again until I went to China on a study abroad trip my junior year of college.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In advance of Spring Festival, the street stalls were suddenly full of bins and bins of White Rabbit candies. Walking the streets around the campus of Nanjing University, I was thrilled to see the candy of my youth. I immediately bought a bag full and brought them back to the dorm.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I passed them around to everyone I met. &quot;I loved these when I was a child,&quot; I explained.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The old man who sat in the guardhouse at the gate politely took a handful but the women who worked in the building merely shook their heads and laughed uncomfortably.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My Chinese roommate looked on in horror. &quot;My grandmother liked those,&quot; she said.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I knew I was a disappointment to her. This whole mixed-nationality roommate situation was an experiment on campus, a sign of China's emergence from decades of seclusion, and was supposed to be an honor. My roommate had signed up and gone through some kind of rigorous screening process. She had been promised an American, and she'd expected some chic blonde white girl with exotic ways and instead she got me, a Chinese American with cheap taste.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Back in our room she pulled out a Toblerone roll from the drawer of her desk and popped a piece in her mouth to make her point.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After that I kept my fetish to myself. But every morning when I woke, the loudspeaker outside our window blaring music for the morning exercises that my roommate and I refused to rise for, I reached from the cocoon of my comforter into the frosty air of our unheated dorm room, and pulled a new White Rabbit from the bag I kept on my desk. I untwisted the familiar white wrapper with the red and blue stripes and the rabbit outlined in blue on the side and popped the candy into my mouth. Pulling my comforter around me, I closed my eyes, as the sensuous layer of sweetened rice paper melted into the milky taffy.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'd come to Nanjing hoping to find some connection to my past, something that would perhaps console me, make up for the losses, for the sense of something missing in me, the hole that was always there in my life in America. But I was no fool. I knew that my grandfather was dead and the China of his memories was gone too, and the Chinese who lived now were rapidly throwing off the past and embracing a future of their own creation. Nothing in China was quite what I'd expected or hoped for. But secretly savoring my White Rabbit each morning gave me courage and sugar and just enough nostalgia to ready myself to get out of bed and embrace the new day.

I passed them around to everyone I met. &quot;I loved these when I was a child,&quot; I explained. The old man who sat in the guardhouse at the gate politely took a handful but the women who worked in the building merely shook their heads and laughed uncomfortably. My Chinese roommate looked on in horror. &quot;My grandmother liked those,&quot; she said. I knew I was a disappointment to her. This whole mixed-nationality roommate situation was an experiment on campus, a sign of China's emergence from decades of seclusion, and was supposed to be an honor. My roommate had signed up and gone through some kind of rigorous screening process. She had been promised an American, and she'd expected some chic blonde white girl with exotic ways and instead she got me, a Chinese American with cheap taste. Back in our room she pulled out a Toblerone roll from the drawer of her desk and popped a piece in her mouth to make her point. After that I kept my fetish to myself. But every morning when I woke, the loudspeaker outside our window blaring music for the morning exercises that my roommate and I refused to rise for, I reached from the cocoon of my comforter into the frosty air of our unheated dorm room, and pulled a new White Rabbit from the bag I kept on my desk. I untwisted the familiar white wrapper with the red and blue stripes and the rabbit outlined in blue on the side and popped the candy into my mouth. Pulling my comforter around me, I closed my eyes, as the sensuous layer of sweetened rice paper melted into the milky taffy. I'd come to Nanjing hoping to find some connection to my past, something that would perhaps console me, make up for the losses, for the sense of something missing in me, the hole that was always there in my life in America. But I was no fool. I knew that my grandfather was dead and the China of his memories was gone too, and the Chinese who lived now were rapidly throwing off the past and embracing a future of their own creation. Nothing in China was quite what I'd expected or hoped for. But secretly savoring my White Rabbit each morning gave me courage and sugar and just enough nostalgia to ready myself to get out of bed and embrace the new day.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Two Nights on 16th Street</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/11-11/Two-Nights-on-16th-Street/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Two Nights on 16th Street" /><published>2018-11-01T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-11-01T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/11-11/two-nights-on-16th-street</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/11-11/Two-Nights-on-16th-Street/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

       Wearing the cheek bones of the mask only

             Pill bottle, my name is yours

Teeth of the mask now

             New phase of anti-anthropomorphism fending for real faces
&lt;br /&gt;
                       Pretending to be a drug addict by day and reading all night

                                                 While economists return to rumors of oxygen
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Stuck with one of those cultures that believes I chose this family
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right; &quot;&gt;
I am not creative
&lt;br /&gt;
Just the silliest of the revolutionaries
&lt;br /&gt;
Conversing with the psychic middleman
&lt;br /&gt;
Or 
&lt;br /&gt;
Wannabe mayor

About hating your enemies

A little more realistically

Our eyesight returning to red/Notepad swimming to red/Bracing for the

I need my left hand back 
&lt;br /&gt;
I broke my neck on the piano keys
&lt;br /&gt;
Found paradise in a fistfight
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Watching the universe’s last metronome

These religions will start resigning in a decade or two

A poet loses his mind, you know, like the room has weather

Poem gravity 
&lt;br /&gt;
Mind-game gravity
&lt;br /&gt;
Or revolution languishing behind 
&lt;br /&gt;
The sugar in my good friend’s mind

My grandchildren would be doomed

A pair of apartments

      Defining both my family

      And political composure
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Books behind my back

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I don’t particularly go in for telling stories, I like to forget things, I forget things on purpose, but if you held a gun to my head and told me that you’d kill me if I didn’t tell you a story–I know what story I would tell you. It’s something that happened to me when I was twenty–four years old that I entirely forgot about (I told you I forget about things on purpose) until yesterday.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I had moved to a small island, population 410. I worked for a small company. The directors made me nervous, but I assumed it was just the natural nervousness of a new job and that it would fade with time. It never did. I never got over the feeling of intimidation I felt around them.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But I learned to act very natural at work. The first day, they gave me what turned out to be my only assignment. “Please, make a spreadsheet of all sources of private funding available from organizations which contained the following code somewhere in their documentation at some point over the past three decades: IjkeRt5671&lt;em&gt;410.” This arcane task became my whole job. It was hard for me to tell what the funds were for as I dutifully logged the data. The language of the documents they had me searching was nominally English, but beyond my ken. “Specialized.”
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I was on the outer circle of the outer circle, a paid gleaner of obscure documents and an occasional proofreader for banal white papers that contained no discernible substance. But I’m ashamed to say I didn’t care: I was indifferent to what they were doing. Vague, embarrassing, and unfulfilled longings for sex and revelation preoccupied me, dampening the faculty of curiosity. I put in my eight hours and I went home.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My employers worked constantly, every day and night, but they didn’t expect me to. I took weekends for myself, though I never left the island. They left me alone on my days off, never calling or intruding on my nights or weekends. As a result, when, about six months into working for them, I saw their number on my phone in the middle of the day on a Saturday, I thought they must have an important reason to call.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I had been at the beach looking at the ocean, not really thinking about anything or doing anything important, just sort of enjoying my raw surroundings and pondering the idea of swimming for the first time since I had moved to the island for the job earlier that year.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My days were stultifying, spent at a desk. I was an assembly line information worker, unable to interpret what I was doing in any meaningful way, even if I _had&lt;/em&gt; cared to (I had given analysis one or two half–hearted tries). I had begun to exist in a perpetual, cobwebbed haze. I had no motivation to do anything creative during my time off and often spent the weekends in a broody stupor, napping, watching movies, staring at the ocean, and reading magazines. But after all, I had aspirations, and it was clear I couldn’t wake myself up on my own. It occurred to me that a plunge into the ocean might be salutary. I had confined myself to admiring the ocean from afar until then, avoided getting to know it on the inside. But on that day, I felt I needed an ordeal. One difficult, delightful, naked and cold–as–fuck slip down, and I’d emerge all new and erased, an elemental reboot. I’d get in and then right back out, cleaving to the shore–I’m not much of a swimmer, to say the least, and the North Atlantic is rough, cold, and full of jellyfish. I was after a wake up, not a negative shock. (And by negative shock, you know what I mean. Even a baby knows what I mean.)
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I had just determined in my mind to get into the water, but had not yet moved, when my phone rang. I answered and one of my employers, answered, saying, “Please, don’t go swimming.” After a pause during which I did not speak, she said it again, “Please, don’t go swimming.”
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
That &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt; of hers–. That was just tact; she wasn’t asking. I could hear her breathing on the other end of the line; I held my own breath. I told myself to respond, but it felt overwhelmingly difficult. The call horrified me.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And then I suddenly realized that since I had not responded, had barely even breathed since first answering the phone, I could pretend that I hadn’t heard her, act like the reception had cut out. I could give a fake response to her fake request. I told my shaking self that that I had a right to–it was the weekend. I felt an imperative to restore normalcy by pretending that this phone call had not happened, as much to myself as to her. Whatever it meant that my employer knew I had intended to go swimming at that moment, even though I was alone and had only &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; about it, I did not want to know. And whatever it meant that she was invading my privacy and instructing me &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to, I was even less inclined to know.&lt;nobr&gt; I warbled, “. . . the reception&lt;/nobr&gt; is bad here, &lt;nobr&gt;I can’t hear you . . . are you there?”&lt;/nobr&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Possibly it was obvious to Rex that I was lying, but that didn’t matter to me. Her call had released me from the obligation to respect reality. I hung up, turned off the phone, and flung it away from me. I ran to the flat where I had been living, and, with a note of regret, which chimed briefly in the cathedral of my relief, I hurriedly packed my few things and caught the next ferry off the island and erased the whole episode from my mind.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Miranda Mellis</name></author><category term="20181111" /><summary type="html">I don’t particularly go in for telling stories, I like to forget things, I forget things on purpose, but if you held a gun to my head and told me that you’d kill me if I didn’t tell you a story–I know what story I would tell you.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Last month the 1959 low-budget monster movie &lt;em&gt;Behemoth&lt;/em&gt; was on TV.  I watched just the ending.  The Behemoth, which looks like an elongated dinosaur with bulgy eyes, wiggles mechanically through the ocean. It’s way bigger than the submarine that’s trying to destroy it.Wham!  It bashes against the side of the sub and water starts leaking from an overhead pipe, provoking tense meaningful eye contact between the two officers manning the controls. They maneuver for a better aim. One yells, “Fire!” and the other grits his teeth and presses a plunger, unloading a bomb that hits the monster in the head. It thrashes and sinks. “That’s it?” I thought. “They killed the thing with one shot?”  These days it would take at least 15 minutes of fast-cut struggle, for we citizens of the 21st century have learned that evil does not die easily. No longer is evil focused like a bad tooth you can root out and get on with your good life.Increasingly diffuse, the Big Scary now spreadsacross networks, sprouting anywhere. We have global warming; we have public executions that shock without warning; we have toxic waters, honey bees threatened with extinction, warnings of plague.  In the White House Americans have installed an irrational, lying, unaccountable crook who rages against “radical Islamic terrorists,” an embarrassingly redundant term. Isn’t radical implied in terrorist? Have you ever heard of a middle brow terrorist? A centrist terrorist? A give-a-cop-a-can-of-Pepsi-and-heal-the-world terrorist?When you’re an American, you’ve gotso much to be embarrassed about. The US has become a very stupid country, and stupidity married to power is danger squared. We’ve given a buffoon the nuclear code.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To be radical you need a wall to bounce your radicalism off of. When you live in a soup of cover ups, corruption and general smarminess, is it possible to clear the mire enough to even find that wall? Those on the radical left claim—and rightly so—that global capitalism is the enemy. But late capitalism is a slippery beast, able to incorporate just about anything into its ravenous maw and spit it back out with a price tag attached. Blind, profit-driven virulence has infiltrated everything, its poison creeping both inside and outside of us. The Behemoth has swallowed the submarine and here we are,flailing in the slimy dark.  In another 1950s cult favorite, &lt;em&gt;The Wild One&lt;/em&gt;, a dancing blonde asks biker Marlon Brando, “Hey, Johnny, what are you rebelling against?” He bongos the top of a jukebox and snarls, “Whatta ya got?” What do we “got”? That is the central question facing us today. Without a focus, without a specific monster in mind to boom boom boom, radical enthusiasm can grind down to depression. We stop reading the news; we post pix of cats on Facebook, flowers on Instagram,obsessively checking for Likes.  Or, like overcrowded rodents, we attack one another.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve got a stalker. I used to be her favorite writer, but when I posted bad opinions in the comments box of another poet’s Facebook thread, her admiration switched to disdain.  She instantly hated me and all I stood for, even things I didn’t realize I stood for, and she began an assault across social media, ridiculing and accusing me. Ifind it difficult, today, toforgive the poets who left encouraging comments for her. I felt shunned and despised, like there was no love in the world for me.Presently emails from online shopping sites began appearing in my in-box, confirming orders I didn’t order, informing me my credit card had beendeclined. My stalker is a monster. She wouldn’t argue with this. Making herself into a monster makes her feel special. It is difficult for the entitled to feel special.Tattoos and heavy eyeliner and revealing little dresses—everybody—even fat girls—hasthose. She posts pictures of her ass to social media; she likes pastries and favors the word “super.” My stalker is a bully. A bully can smell someone who has been previously bullied—the bully and the bullied fit together like jigsaw puzzle pieces. I imagine her alone in the middle of the night, ashtray on her nightstand overflowing with butts, drunk, or buzzed on Adderall, maybe both, afraid to sleep due to last night’s bout of sleep paralysis, the tension is unbearable—tight jaw compacted heart—she searches for something crappy online—adds it to her shopping cart, enters my name address phone number, which she copied down the summer she interned for that radical indie press—her taut little body vibrates as she enters a fake credit card number, presses the PLACE ORDER button, pummeling me with hubcaps peonies guitar strings silk sock liners—what a fucking rush what a release—almost as good as the burst she gets when she slicesher inner thigh with a razor blade—it’s like she’s sending me all her pain, her disappointment her god-awful ordinariness. Afterwards she feels a terrible intimacy, that of the torturer who comes to love her victim.

With the election of Trump, poets decided that the only acceptable way to depict an American flag was upside down. When a provocateurpoet posted a flag rightside up on Instagram, there was an angry Facebook thread about it. Poet A saidthat if he had known the flag poet was so fucked up, he never would have had himread in his series. Poets B and C proposed informing the flag poet’s employer about the offense and getting him fired. None of the poets noticed that the posted flag wasn’t a real American flag, but the fake Chinese-made flag that had been in the news, the onethat unwitting patriots had purchased, with too many stars.  Kevin back channeled poet B and pointed this out:  &lt;em&gt;That is not the regular flag.  It has far too many stars.  It is the 61-star flag that indicates the alternate history of America. _Whether or not that’s a good thing or a bad depends how you feel about the flag today, and if you believe that the US took a wrong turn somewhere back in history. The regular flag has only 50 stars—supposedly for each state in the union.&lt;/em&gt; However, poet B didn’t back down. He said he couldn’t understand what a 61-star flag would signify. He said that regardless of the flag poet’s intention,to be oblique on something this sensitive was aggressive, and the rightside up flag still reinscribed violence.  If one is vague, poets will project the worst into your words. If you refer to a person but don’t name names, poets will assume it’s themselves or someone you’d never dream of. AtAlley Cat Books the reader launches into a poem so politically correct you could bounce a dime off of it, political in all the right ways—and apoet in the audience starts nodding his head wildly back and forth as if it were a rattle. The rest of the reading he hasa normal head. Political writing is straightforward, plain, and “learned,” prefaced by a declaration of the author’s identity markers.  &lt;em&gt;As a white cis American working class college-educated Baby Boomer who lives in California and prefers unoaked Chardonnay . . . .&lt;/em&gt;  Political writing is careful about who owns what experience.  Someone tweets:  &lt;em&gt;She doesn’t have the right to talk about that,&lt;/em&gt; and you feel shame.  When a poet rants against me and the politics of my writing on Facebook, she begins with “What kind of woman would . . . .”  &lt;em&gt;What kind of woman&lt;/em&gt; implies a correct, proper version of femaleness—and I—not being that kind of woman—have crossed over into an impossible otherness. It doesn’t matter what else shegoes on to accuse me of, &lt;em&gt;What kind of woman&lt;/em&gt; has declared me an abomination. Sincechildhood I’ve been criticized for my nonstandard female embodiment.  I was savage and unruly, clomping through life like a bull—and now I’m an old white feminist—an oppressor in a pink pussy hat.  The Facebook poet’s cursesscatter across my features like the points in facial recognition software, a surveillance grid that hardens on my face like a mask. No expression is possible in thetightness of her projections.  Thought criminals need to be rooted out and shunned, the dead as well as the living.  Cindy Sherman.  Gandhi. Marjorie Perloff. Walt Whitman. &lt;em&gt;And what I assume you shall assume,/ For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.&lt;/em&gt;  Community walks within me and thus I contain both criminal and accuser.  The idiocy of the American government, I contain that as well.  In a muck of warring poets, I spew that war.  Heriberto Yépez: &lt;em&gt;Networks are both migrants and the gatekeepers.&lt;/em&gt;  The madness of social media, it too walks within me.I operate in the dangerous and contradictory realm of the in-between. Neither goddess nor heroine, I am an old white feminist, a shriveled hag envious of my stalker’s fertility and youthful beauty.  My hair is coarse and unkempt; my long hanging dugs bounce about like phalluses.  I befoul Poetry with my personal essays, which are riddledwith superstition, deceit, defective intelligence, lust, and debauchery. I am simultaneously horrific and ridiculous. My politics are so odious I’ve made pacts with rapists.Though he’s taken the form of a goat, I kiss the abuser’s backside; I apologize for him.

In a skit called “Silver Surfers,” Tracey Ullman plays a teacher who shows seniorshow to troll the internet. A woman says she’dlike to see her grandson’s YouTube channel. Tracey turns on a video of a grade schoolboy demonstrating something. She notes how the video is amateurish in quality, and tells the class that when you see somebody getting it wrong online it’s important to point it out to them. Tracey instructs the class to click the thumbs down button—or if they want to make it more personal to post a comment, using a fake name, in which they say either he has a voice like a girl or everyone here wishes he were dead. Tracey types on the grandmother’s computer, “Wish you were dead, loser.” “It’s a real thrill when you click that send button,” she says.

The internet, like late capitalism, is everywhere and nowhere. My stalker sends me objects that are not objects. They’re images I keep trying to push into language. According to capitalism, what you own you are. Lawn plants, chenille bedspread,frilly dresses, Forest Friends felt Christmas ornament kit, fish pond water conditioner, hubcaps. What is the stalker saying to/about methroughthese suburban talismans? According tocapitalism, whoever controls images controls the world.  I say to my psychic, I think I know who’s been stalking me, but I’m not sure. My psychic says,&lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt;.  How can I control these images that have been thrust upon me?  I imagine a woman who wears floral dresses, a widow with a four-year old toddler.  She loved her husband and always wears a peridot pendant that contains a bit of his ashes.  She’s a photographer who plays the cello and drives a motorcycle.  Alone in the house she feels vulnerable, so she keeps a gun under her pillow.  She has a home office, a file box where she stores her photos.  She’s femmy and a bit old fashioned. She sleeps under a tufted chenille bedspread; she usesface firming creams and bikini exfoliators. She’s trying to fix herself up to get another man. She gardens, preferring bulb plants from Holland—so she lives somewhere with a yard, a rural or suburban landscape. People do not suspect her wildness—the gun, the motorcycle—but it’s there waiting to take over. She likes bargains, preferring tobuythings on sale, with coupon codes or open boxes. She has aBlu-rayplayer to help her through her lonely nights. Or maybe she met a manwho ownsa gun. He’s arebel who deserves her bikini-groomed snatch.  This new man likes porn; when she’s ready he plans to share some with her on the Samsung Blu-ray player he noticed in the living room. They sit in her garden with its lush greens, irises and peonies, holding hands, kissing lightly, then more and more passionately.  Let’s make itthe guy who has the motorcycle. He’s aMarlon Brando type—a vet who’s living off of disability—going to art school in photography, and these things my stalker ordered are gifts for him, the wheel, the gun cleaner, the camera. She drives a car—a fully restored 61 Dodge Polara, which totally impresses the vet. That’s howthey met—at a light he pulled up beside her on his motorcycle and asked her if she wanted to grab some coffee.  After the coffee, the woman and the photographer fuck in the garden beside the koi pond, which is mercifully devoid of chlorine fumes thanks to Tetra Pond AquaSafe Tap Water Conditioner. Their sex isprotected from nosey neighbors by a clump of kingsize hostas. The female koi are named after female science fiction writers, Doris Lessing, Octavia Butler; the male fish are named after 20th century avant garde composers, Boulez, Webern. Last weekraccoons ate Ursula K. Le Guin, and before that they got Joanna Russ and Schoenberg, so that the woman is considering replacing the koi with a cheaper species, such as goldfish. The vet’s cock is pink and clean, squeaky clean like the Army taught him to keep it in their anti-VD training videos, well-scrubbed as his gun, the barrel of which he regularly plunges with Brownells Moly Bore Treatment Paste.  The woman’s Diane von Furstenberg dress is pushed up to her waist.  The vet pulls out his Nikon Coolpix and shoots a close up of the twig and gravel scratches on her ass.  The Samsung Blu-ray player blasts “Bang a Gong.”  HUBCAP DIAMOND STAR HALO.  According to capitalism, accessories are personality. Commodities morph into character traits, morph into narrative momentum.  Personal memories and product reviews on Amazon provide supplemental details.  My fuck scene would be more erotic if there were more of a buildupbut the woman is always ready. Too eager, perhaps. She can come without touching herself. Her cunt is so strong it could lift barbells, if she owned any.  Sometimes the photographer complains she’s clenching him too tightly, but her cunt is ravenous for him, wants to absorb every drop his cock can offer. Afterwards she doesn’t wash,enjoying his semen smeared over her legs and belly, dripping out of her, and besides, the stalker hasn’t ordered her any soap.

The first target of massive internet shaming and harassment was Monica Lewinsky, in 1998. She was 22 years old and, being the first, she had no context or support to help her cope. These days she finds comfort and purpose in her work with anti-harassment and bullying organizations. Her taped phone conversations with Linda Tripp are available on YouTube, hours of rambling female intimacy. I envy the closeness of the two women, the way they coddle the micro details of one another’s lives—everything from the temptation of donuts at the hairdresser—Monica’s favorite is white frosting with multi-colored sprinkles—to why won’t Bill call me. The conversations begin after Clinton has dumped Monica and track her heartbreak and desperate attempts to contact him. I’d love to have a girlfriend I could talk to endlessly about all my shit—someone as doting and supportive as Linda, someone who would slather me with such love. The betrayal by Tripp alone would devastate anyone—and that’s just a footnote to Monica’s collapse. If old white feminists ruled the world, one woman defiling another would be a capital offense.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
On Facebook, a male poet posts a photo of a naked man striding down the street. In the comments section, a female poet writes she finds the photo so upsetting her hands are shaking, and she just has to speak out. She’s decided the person in the photo is a mentally ill homeless man—even though there is nothing in the photo or the male poet’s post that announces that. Her extreme reaction to her (own) invented narrative prompts her to condemn the male poet and the hundred people who liked the image. I read on the internet that suggesting self-control online is_tone policing, and I am wrong to go there. Maybe she’s right, we’re all a bunch of assholes laughing at the disenfranchised—or maybe he’s a gay nudist—in San Francisco it’s not uncommon to see naked men walking down the street, alone or in groups. The photo is of the man’s back, taken at a distance, maybe he has a glittering gold tube sock stuck on his cock. I’ve seen so many men with socks on their cocks—including panhandling teens on Castro Street. To get more money, I assume. No matter how much you stare at the image, it refuses to cough up more clues. Is it possible to keep your righteous fingers away from the keyboard? Is it possible to live without diminishing or oppressing another? Jain ascetics with soft broomsmade of shed peacock feathers, gently sweeping the ground lest they step on an insect. What are the limits of reverence?
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We make soup, we write tight little narratives where all messy threads are tied up, neatly, at the end.  We read books on organizing our home. Rooms turn vast with order,withsimplicity. We have only what we need, what we cherish, and there is a place for everything we own.Possessionsare instantly findable and they are happy to serve us. The stalker destroys time, categories and meaning, locking memories and dreams in the present moment. The mind strains against the body to push thoughts out.  Everything is impure.  The daily taunts and jeers I experienced as a child are happening right now right here.  I’m pooping my guts out,taking slow breaths against the pain. My body is twisting my subjectivity, wringing it out likeone of those old time washing machines my grandmother had.  Whenever anyone laughs they are laughing at me. The stalker has brokenthe frame. The process ofwriting this essay creates a new frame that proves I am capable of at least the most basic adult human functioning.  How do you express trauma when linearity fails you?  You order products online for your enemy.  When the past possesses the present you enter the now now now of spurting adrenaline, and your irises spinlike pinwheels. The pix shriek nobody wants you here the pix shriek you are hated everybody hates you. I publish a piece in a journal my stalker has also published in. I imagine her reading it with scorn, searching for bits out of context she can use to destroy me. “Dodie Bellamy said” becomes a tagline to ruin. On_Nashville, Will, the gay character, is being bashed on Twitter and bam! his trauma is my trauma panic blots out the present like one of those bags terrorists shove over a captive’s head. I am forever a child useless andhumiliated. I am a radiant pink clit inflamed bythe eros of my stalker’s loathing.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My stalker hates capitalism.  I believe she hates capitalism more than she hates me.  Headline on the internet:  &lt;em&gt;A majority of millennials now reject capitalism, poll shows&lt;/em&gt;. My stalker says that if she could have anything in the world she wished for, it would be to destroycapitalism. My stalker believes that by shoplifting items made by slaves in China she is fuckingcapitalism. When I was young I’d shoplift with friends but I was too much of a pussy to do it on my own. My friend Jackie—who was a pro—and I would come home with huge hauls of stuff, most of which I’d end up not wanting, and I had to figure out how to get rid of.  Before we went on a run, we’d put on makeup and work dresses and little heels; our aesthetic was clueless middle class bargain hunter. Jackie’s first rule: no backpacks or large purses while shoplifting. We carried moderately-sized shoulder bags. They looked like they couldn’t hold much of anything—but you’d be surprised. I once smashed a fluffy pink prom dress into one. Jackie’s second rule was entitlement. When she found a stainless steel fish poacher she liked, she just picked it up and marched out of Macys with it, and nobody blinked. Despite itsheart-thumping arousal, hours of nonstopshoplifting was exhausting. I felt buried in commodity culture and the treadmill of consumption that drivescapitalism’s insatiable thrust. It was gross.When Jackie and I returned to my apartment, we dumped our haul onto my bed in a jumbled mountain, and then we belly-flopped onto it, shrieking, carefree as dogs rolling around in shit.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
One night, over a period two hours, thirteenthings were ordered in my name, each from a different website. Then a coupleof hours later, another item, bringing the total to fourteenin one evening. Could one person possibly have ordered this much, this quickly? Or was somebody throwing aHarass Dodie party?  I sat down at my desk and started emailing the companies—This order is fraudulent.  I also downloaded the product photos per artist friend Kristina Lee Podesva’s suggestion. When I told her about my stalker, excitement spread across Kristina’s face and she exclaimed, “Document this!”The order confirmations were coming in so furiously I couldn’t keep up.  I could only imagine that the person on the other end was tweaking.  I checked my stalker’s Twitter feed. She tweeted before the ordering frenzy began and then not again until ten or fifteenminutes after it ended,when she wrote—My mother just asked me if I was on heroin. A few minutes later she tweeted—I’m reading inPhiladelphia, if you come bring me flowers—peonies. Peony bulbs were one of the fourteen items. The world goes crazy with connection.  I say to my psychic, I think I know who it is, but I’m not sure. My psychic says,&lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt;.  My stalker sends me a widow’s walk and a necklace to contain the ashes of a loved one—is she casting a spell of doom on me? What does an office chair mean?  It requires work for me to write back to all these companies, but it also requires a hell of a lot of commitment and focused attention for her to order all this stuff.  Her curated images are about potential, about our post-industrial condition, in which we sit at machines pushing around bytes, alone, longing to reach out.  Glamor shots of merchandise hail her and she clicks them with the grammarless fever of a rat clicking a food-delivery lever. Eventually the image objects arrive on my computer and I click them with confusion and fear and anger, but also with a twinge of pleasure that reminds me of playing &lt;em&gt;Monument Valley,&lt;/em&gt; my bumbling attempts to navigate a twisting architecture whose rules endlessly elude.  Objects speak with the indeterminacy of a cry, garbledlike puppets with their lips sewn shut. Yet it’s impossible not to narrativize them.  To the protest, my stalker wears cotton toddler panties stretched tight across hercooch. Beneath her sheer Diane Von Furstenberg dress, areolas bloom, lush pink peonies.Comrades and government infiltrators alike find her unbearably sexy.  Anything you send a writer is a gift. A suicidal young woman pulls up on a motorcycle. I rub her face into mydesiccated crotch, suck the bloomfrom her cheeks and cough up bile. My breath is so foul sperm curdles and young Marxists faint.  &lt;em&gt;I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable,/ I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Before I became a middle class person I shopped only at thrift stores, so the clothes I owned were jeans, striped long-sleeved tees, and party dresses. When I got my first middle class job, I went to Macys and charged these awfuloutfits—polyester pants suits, etc.—I looked like a clown, a droopy professional clown.  The middle class likes different things than the working class, but we all want things things things things—even homeless people in my neighborhood wheel shopping carts and suitcases overflowing with things.  If capitalism were destroyed, would the homeless have better things?  The viscosity of capitalism swallows us. We are never sure if we are inside or outside of it. It spreads over the globe making things stick together. I walk down the street wearing bits of China India Portugal Vietnam, andoccasionallythe USA. The ghosts of nameless workers vape from my silhouette, rendering me not one but many.  My boss said my best middle class outfit was one I shoplifted with Jackie—a navy cashmere shift by Ralph Lauren.  For the bourgeois subject wouldn’t guilt be a more appropriate response thanhate? Perhaps guilt is what’s really behind the attacking of those perceived politically impure. Like a game of tag,you spread the cooties to those not deft enough to sidestep your fingering.  Anyone who’s seen a zombie movie knows that when capitalism is destroyedwe don’t get utopia. We get poetry bandits who police the perimeters. Law like a person has an unconscious. What my stalker really wants to destroy is the stink of trauma that wafts off of her.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I provide a focal point for my stalker’s hate, a manageable target for the all-consuming vastness of her rage. If she didn’t have me, maybe she’d jump off a bridge or shoot up a post office, who knows.It’s the middle of the night and allthis pressure is trapped in her body, enormous pressure she can’t release. She wants to sigh, to scream, to burst out crying. But nothing moves. Stuck in a limbo of angst, where sadness and fury are all mucked up together, ongoing and escalating, my stalkerlooks over her list of enemies. It’s Dodie tonight.  People rarely do things just to be wicked—they act because they’re convinced they’ve encountered evil, convinced that innocents need protecting—or they perceive their livelihood is threatened—or a great wrong has been committed against them.  Throughout history, horrible things—I don’t need to list them—have been done with God on our side, things that must have felt honorable at the time, but whose cruelty today shocks us.  Powerful feelings can fuck you up, especially when fucked-up you feel you have the right to fuck up others.  On the internet I read about a guy who stalked a woman for five years.  Helen reported 125 incidents of harassment but the police did nothing until he attacked her with a pair of scissors, stabbing her multiple times on the neck, face, and back.  It took a lot of googling to find out what Helen did to deserve her “living nightmare.”  She met Joseph at a halfway house where she was recovering from an eating disorder.  They became friends, until one night Joseph asked Helen to drive him and anotherfriend to see a band called Carnaby Street. Helen didn’t feelup to it and said she’d text him if she changed her mind. Joseph felt stood up, and his affection for Helen instantlyturned into burning hatred. So he vandalized her car, made silent phone calls, left a dead cat on her doorstep, smashed her windows,sent her letters calling her fat and rat-faced, spray-painted Die Helen across a brick wall, nearly killed her.  Because she didn’t go to a concert.  There is always a reason to destroy another.  Anybody who needs a reason will find one.  I was my stalker’s favorite writer until I posted a comment on a poet’s Facebook thread, three years ago.  Before that I have no memory of having met her or heard of her. Though I think that’s not true;most likely I was in many rooms with her, rooms filled with poetry.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I learn from the internet that mobbing should not be confused with gang stalking. Mobbing is perpetrated by a closed, defined group, such as an academic department or poetry community. Gang stalking is perpetrated by government/corporate agencies. Black vans sit outside your apartment, trail you down the street.  Satellites beam voices into your brain via nanotechnology implanted in your skull. The voices arerelentless and abrasive. They say everybody hates you. They urge you to harm yourself and others.  Eventually you find out you are part of a vast government/corporate experiment whose goal is to break people, and then through mind control to create spies who don’t even know they’re spies. Mind control makes the best kind of spy because no matter how much the targeted individual is tortured, they can’t reveal secretsthey don’t know they have. Their secrets are hidden deep within their brain behind an altar thatonly the programmers know how to unlock. The Russians have implanted nanotechnology inside Trump’s head, and that’s why he does their bidding.  The programmers can kill youby remote control, make your heart clench, make you vomit liters of black goo. The whole thing’s set up to look like paranoid schizophrenia sothat targeted individuals aren’t taken seriously.  But these people hold conventions and tell their stories to the masses via websites and YouTube videos.  &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; made a documentary about them.  The psychological torture is so intense, many targeted individuals commit suicide. Some of them give in to the voices and go on a shooting spree.The internet is a cacophony of voices beaming love or hate at you, depending on your age race gender sexual preference body type politics. The internet can gather 2000 signatures against you overnight.You can be condemned on the merest wisp of data.  Even if you aren’t the one who committed a crime, if you criticize mob action in the comment section of a poet’s Facebook feed, you’re labeled an apologist and you’re just as evil as the worst rapist or racist, and young womenyou barely know will hate you forever. If you protest they’ll hate you even more. If you block them on Facebook they’ll condemn you for silencing them. They’llpost screenshots of things you’ve written—out of context—and since you’re old and not as online savvy you don’t know how to make each post discrete, like a hologramwith its context imbedded within it rather than depending on other posts for context. Powerful male mentors will boost their slanderous lies about you and no one will come to your defense except Brian Kim Stefans, who lives like a million miles away in Los Angeles. Locals will tell you privately they agree with you and they’re appalled by your treatment but they dare not say anything. And young guys who you thought were your friends will lecture you on your anti-feminist behavior. There’s only one response available to any guy who would lecture you on feminism and that’s fuck off,but still your heart breaks because you cared for them in an age-appropriate way, as if they were cute spaniels with big floppy ears. The poetry community you’ve been devoted to since the early 80s is no longer safe, and even those who didn’t mob you, you see them mobbing others, andthis you cannot abide.  On the internet you learn that when someone is directing negative energy at you, you should imagine yourself covered by mirrors and bounce that negative energy back to them. You should ground yourself by drinking chlorophyll, trace minerals, and specially ionized water.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
By harassing me does my stalker believe she’s saving Poetry or is she merely a sociopath lusting for blood?  I read on the internet that stalking is like a long rape.  Before such violence there is no place for obliqueness.  Every piece I’ve ever written has centered around love, no matter how fucked up its manifestation. But this girl and her actions, I can find no love here to cling to, not even a spark. She’s like that evil queen who fed Snow White the poison apple. She’s a cliché of viciousness the internet has birthed.  I sit at the computer fortressed in mirrors, my eyes peering through a narrow slit. I click theMail icon. Something new has been ordered—three jars of moly bore treatment paste.  I learn on the internet that your rub this paste on the inside of your rifle barrel in order to reduce friction for minimum fouling, faster, easier cleanup and longer barrel life.  My stalker posts Tinder screenshots from interested guys below her league and ridicules them. She posts provocative pictures of herself—flimsy teddies and wisps of panties she can pull aside in order to selfie her ass—andfantasizesthe FBI agents she’s sure are surveilling her because she’s a radical are jerking off to her image. When I was a child Ifantasized God was watching me, and so I would do cute things for God, inspired by the TV show &lt;em&gt;Candid Camera,&lt;/em&gt; which made Cold War surveillance culture fun. At any momentyou could step out of ordinary life and do something adorable or amusing enough to be broadcast to all of America. With earbud attached to a coiled cord that trails from ear to back of neck and disappears into their dark jackets, FBI agents are forced to observe you. It is their job to remain professional and implacable, but your dirty talk on Twitter, your skimpy selfies are so damned seductive—flies zip open, well-scrubbed cocks pop out, sunglassed heads arc backwards in rapture.I learn on the internet that people who try to harm you are in fact possessed by negative entities, entities that they areunaware of. Therefore I say to my stalker—&lt;em&gt;You need to ground and clear yourself because you _seem to&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;possessed.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;em&gt;In your latest selfies you look awfully animalistic.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;em&gt;You should drink some chlorophyll&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;and wear&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;a lead-lined hoodie&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;to bed&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;to protect yourself from&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;the government/corporate complex&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;is beaming these terrible thoughts into your head.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Dodie Bellamy</name></author><category term="20181111" /><summary type="html">Last month the 1959 low-budget monster movie Behemoth was on TV. I watched just the ending. The Behemoth, which looks like an elongated dinosaur with bulgy eyes, wiggles mechanically through the ocean. It’s way bigger than the submarine that’s trying to destroy it.Wham! It bashes against the side of the sub and water starts leaking from an overhead pipe, provoking tense meaningful eye contact between the two officers manning the controls. They maneuver for a better aim. One yells, “Fire!” and the other grits his teeth and presses a plunger, unloading a bomb that hits the monster in the head. It thrashes and sinks. “That’s it?” I thought. “They killed the thing with one shot?” These days it would take at least 15 minutes of fast-cut struggle, for we citizens of the 21st century have learned that evil does not die easily. No longer is evil focused like a bad tooth you can root out and get on with your good life.Increasingly diffuse, the Big Scary now spreadsacross networks, sprouting anywhere. We have global warming; we have public executions that shock without warning; we have toxic waters, honey bees threatened with extinction, warnings of plague. In the White House Americans have installed an irrational, lying, unaccountable crook who rages against “radical Islamic terrorists,” an embarrassingly redundant term. Isn’t radical implied in terrorist? Have you ever heard of a middle brow terrorist? A centrist terrorist? A give-a-cop-a-can-of-Pepsi-and-heal-the-world terrorist?When you’re an American, you’ve gotso much to be embarrassed about. The US has become a very stupid country, and stupidity married to power is danger squared. We’ve given a buffoon the nuclear code. To be radical you need a wall to bounce your radicalism off of. When you live in a soup of cover ups, corruption and general smarminess, is it possible to clear the mire enough to even find that wall? Those on the radical left claim—and rightly so—that global capitalism is the enemy. But late capitalism is a slippery beast, able to incorporate just about anything into its ravenous maw and spit it back out with a price tag attached. Blind, profit-driven virulence has infiltrated everything, its poison creeping both inside and outside of us. The Behemoth has swallowed the submarine and here we are,flailing in the slimy dark. In another 1950s cult favorite, The Wild One, a dancing blonde asks biker Marlon Brando, “Hey, Johnny, what are you rebelling against?” He bongos the top of a jukebox and snarls, “Whatta ya got?” What do we “got”? That is the central question facing us today. Without a focus, without a specific monster in mind to boom boom boom, radical enthusiasm can grind down to depression. We stop reading the news; we post pix of cats on Facebook, flowers on Instagram,obsessively checking for Likes. Or, like overcrowded rodents, we attack one another. I’ve got a stalker. I used to be her favorite writer, but when I posted bad opinions in the comments box of another poet’s Facebook thread, her admiration switched to disdain. She instantly hated me and all I stood for, even things I didn’t realize I stood for, and she began an assault across social media, ridiculing and accusing me. Ifind it difficult, today, toforgive the poets who left encouraging comments for her. I felt shunned and despised, like there was no love in the world for me.Presently emails from online shopping sites began appearing in my in-box, confirming orders I didn’t order, informing me my credit card had beendeclined. My stalker is a monster. She wouldn’t argue with this. Making herself into a monster makes her feel special. It is difficult for the entitled to feel special.Tattoos and heavy eyeliner and revealing little dresses—everybody—even fat girls—hasthose. She posts pictures of her ass to social media; she likes pastries and favors the word “super.” My stalker is a bully. A bully can smell someone who has been previously bullied—the bully and the bullied fit together like jigsaw puzzle pieces. I imagine her alone in the middle of the night, ashtray on her nightstand overflowing with butts, drunk, or buzzed on Adderall, maybe both, afraid to sleep due to last night’s bout of sleep paralysis, the tension is unbearable—tight jaw compacted heart—she searches for something crappy online—adds it to her shopping cart, enters my name address phone number, which she copied down the summer she interned for that radical indie press—her taut little body vibrates as she enters a fake credit card number, presses the PLACE ORDER button, pummeling me with hubcaps peonies guitar strings silk sock liners—what a fucking rush what a release—almost as good as the burst she gets when she slicesher inner thigh with a razor blade—it’s like she’s sending me all her pain, her disappointment her god-awful ordinariness. Afterwards she feels a terrible intimacy, that of the torturer who comes to love her victim. With the election of Trump, poets decided that the only acceptable way to depict an American flag was upside down. When a provocateurpoet posted a flag rightside up on Instagram, there was an angry Facebook thread about it. Poet A saidthat if he had known the flag poet was so fucked up, he never would have had himread in his series. Poets B and C proposed informing the flag poet’s employer about the offense and getting him fired. None of the poets noticed that the posted flag wasn’t a real American flag, but the fake Chinese-made flag that had been in the news, the onethat unwitting patriots had purchased, with too many stars. Kevin back channeled poet B and pointed this out: That is not the regular flag. It has far too many stars. It is the 61-star flag that indicates the alternate history of America. _Whether or not that’s a good thing or a bad depends how you feel about the flag today, and if you believe that the US took a wrong turn somewhere back in history. The regular flag has only 50 stars—supposedly for each state in the union. However, poet B didn’t back down. He said he couldn’t understand what a 61-star flag would signify. He said that regardless of the flag poet’s intention,to be oblique on something this sensitive was aggressive, and the rightside up flag still reinscribed violence. If one is vague, poets will project the worst into your words. If you refer to a person but don’t name names, poets will assume it’s themselves or someone you’d never dream of. AtAlley Cat Books the reader launches into a poem so politically correct you could bounce a dime off of it, political in all the right ways—and apoet in the audience starts nodding his head wildly back and forth as if it were a rattle. The rest of the reading he hasa normal head. Political writing is straightforward, plain, and “learned,” prefaced by a declaration of the author’s identity markers. As a white cis American working class college-educated Baby Boomer who lives in California and prefers unoaked Chardonnay . . . . Political writing is careful about who owns what experience. Someone tweets: She doesn’t have the right to talk about that, and you feel shame. When a poet rants against me and the politics of my writing on Facebook, she begins with “What kind of woman would . . . .” What kind of woman implies a correct, proper version of femaleness—and I—not being that kind of woman—have crossed over into an impossible otherness. It doesn’t matter what else shegoes on to accuse me of, What kind of woman has declared me an abomination. Sincechildhood I’ve been criticized for my nonstandard female embodiment. I was savage and unruly, clomping through life like a bull—and now I’m an old white feminist—an oppressor in a pink pussy hat. The Facebook poet’s cursesscatter across my features like the points in facial recognition software, a surveillance grid that hardens on my face like a mask. No expression is possible in thetightness of her projections. Thought criminals need to be rooted out and shunned, the dead as well as the living. Cindy Sherman. Gandhi. Marjorie Perloff. Walt Whitman. And what I assume you shall assume,/ For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you. Community walks within me and thus I contain both criminal and accuser. The idiocy of the American government, I contain that as well. In a muck of warring poets, I spew that war. Heriberto Yépez: Networks are both migrants and the gatekeepers. The madness of social media, it too walks within me.I operate in the dangerous and contradictory realm of the in-between. Neither goddess nor heroine, I am an old white feminist, a shriveled hag envious of my stalker’s fertility and youthful beauty. My hair is coarse and unkempt; my long hanging dugs bounce about like phalluses. I befoul Poetry with my personal essays, which are riddledwith superstition, deceit, defective intelligence, lust, and debauchery. I am simultaneously horrific and ridiculous. My politics are so odious I’ve made pacts with rapists.Though he’s taken the form of a goat, I kiss the abuser’s backside; I apologize for him. In a skit called “Silver Surfers,” Tracey Ullman plays a teacher who shows seniorshow to troll the internet. A woman says she’dlike to see her grandson’s YouTube channel. Tracey turns on a video of a grade schoolboy demonstrating something. She notes how the video is amateurish in quality, and tells the class that when you see somebody getting it wrong online it’s important to point it out to them. Tracey instructs the class to click the thumbs down button—or if they want to make it more personal to post a comment, using a fake name, in which they say either he has a voice like a girl or everyone here wishes he were dead. Tracey types on the grandmother’s computer, “Wish you were dead, loser.” “It’s a real thrill when you click that send button,” she says. The internet, like late capitalism, is everywhere and nowhere. My stalker sends me objects that are not objects. They’re images I keep trying to push into language. According to capitalism, what you own you are. Lawn plants, chenille bedspread,frilly dresses, Forest Friends felt Christmas ornament kit, fish pond water conditioner, hubcaps. What is the stalker saying to/about methroughthese suburban talismans? According tocapitalism, whoever controls images controls the world. I say to my psychic, I think I know who’s been stalking me, but I’m not sure. My psychic says,you know. How can I control these images that have been thrust upon me? I imagine a woman who wears floral dresses, a widow with a four-year old toddler. She loved her husband and always wears a peridot pendant that contains a bit of his ashes. She’s a photographer who plays the cello and drives a motorcycle. Alone in the house she feels vulnerable, so she keeps a gun under her pillow. She has a home office, a file box where she stores her photos. She’s femmy and a bit old fashioned. She sleeps under a tufted chenille bedspread; she usesface firming creams and bikini exfoliators. She’s trying to fix herself up to get another man. She gardens, preferring bulb plants from Holland—so she lives somewhere with a yard, a rural or suburban landscape. People do not suspect her wildness—the gun, the motorcycle—but it’s there waiting to take over. She likes bargains, preferring tobuythings on sale, with coupon codes or open boxes. She has aBlu-rayplayer to help her through her lonely nights. Or maybe she met a manwho ownsa gun. He’s arebel who deserves her bikini-groomed snatch. This new man likes porn; when she’s ready he plans to share some with her on the Samsung Blu-ray player he noticed in the living room. They sit in her garden with its lush greens, irises and peonies, holding hands, kissing lightly, then more and more passionately. Let’s make itthe guy who has the motorcycle. He’s aMarlon Brando type—a vet who’s living off of disability—going to art school in photography, and these things my stalker ordered are gifts for him, the wheel, the gun cleaner, the camera. She drives a car—a fully restored 61 Dodge Polara, which totally impresses the vet. That’s howthey met—at a light he pulled up beside her on his motorcycle and asked her if she wanted to grab some coffee. After the coffee, the woman and the photographer fuck in the garden beside the koi pond, which is mercifully devoid of chlorine fumes thanks to Tetra Pond AquaSafe Tap Water Conditioner. Their sex isprotected from nosey neighbors by a clump of kingsize hostas. The female koi are named after female science fiction writers, Doris Lessing, Octavia Butler; the male fish are named after 20th century avant garde composers, Boulez, Webern. Last weekraccoons ate Ursula K. Le Guin, and before that they got Joanna Russ and Schoenberg, so that the woman is considering replacing the koi with a cheaper species, such as goldfish. The vet’s cock is pink and clean, squeaky clean like the Army taught him to keep it in their anti-VD training videos, well-scrubbed as his gun, the barrel of which he regularly plunges with Brownells Moly Bore Treatment Paste. The woman’s Diane von Furstenberg dress is pushed up to her waist. The vet pulls out his Nikon Coolpix and shoots a close up of the twig and gravel scratches on her ass. The Samsung Blu-ray player blasts “Bang a Gong.” HUBCAP DIAMOND STAR HALO. According to capitalism, accessories are personality. Commodities morph into character traits, morph into narrative momentum. Personal memories and product reviews on Amazon provide supplemental details. My fuck scene would be more erotic if there were more of a buildupbut the woman is always ready. Too eager, perhaps. She can come without touching herself. Her cunt is so strong it could lift barbells, if she owned any. Sometimes the photographer complains she’s clenching him too tightly, but her cunt is ravenous for him, wants to absorb every drop his cock can offer. Afterwards she doesn’t wash,enjoying his semen smeared over her legs and belly, dripping out of her, and besides, the stalker hasn’t ordered her any soap. The first target of massive internet shaming and harassment was Monica Lewinsky, in 1998. She was 22 years old and, being the first, she had no context or support to help her cope. These days she finds comfort and purpose in her work with anti-harassment and bullying organizations. Her taped phone conversations with Linda Tripp are available on YouTube, hours of rambling female intimacy. I envy the closeness of the two women, the way they coddle the micro details of one another’s lives—everything from the temptation of donuts at the hairdresser—Monica’s favorite is white frosting with multi-colored sprinkles—to why won’t Bill call me. The conversations begin after Clinton has dumped Monica and track her heartbreak and desperate attempts to contact him. I’d love to have a girlfriend I could talk to endlessly about all my shit—someone as doting and supportive as Linda, someone who would slather me with such love. The betrayal by Tripp alone would devastate anyone—and that’s just a footnote to Monica’s collapse. If old white feminists ruled the world, one woman defiling another would be a capital offense. On Facebook, a male poet posts a photo of a naked man striding down the street. In the comments section, a female poet writes she finds the photo so upsetting her hands are shaking, and she just has to speak out. She’s decided the person in the photo is a mentally ill homeless man—even though there is nothing in the photo or the male poet’s post that announces that. Her extreme reaction to her (own) invented narrative prompts her to condemn the male poet and the hundred people who liked the image. I read on the internet that suggesting self-control online is_tone policing, and I am wrong to go there. Maybe she’s right, we’re all a bunch of assholes laughing at the disenfranchised—or maybe he’s a gay nudist—in San Francisco it’s not uncommon to see naked men walking down the street, alone or in groups. The photo is of the man’s back, taken at a distance, maybe he has a glittering gold tube sock stuck on his cock. I’ve seen so many men with socks on their cocks—including panhandling teens on Castro Street. To get more money, I assume. No matter how much you stare at the image, it refuses to cough up more clues. Is it possible to keep your righteous fingers away from the keyboard? Is it possible to live without diminishing or oppressing another? Jain ascetics with soft broomsmade of shed peacock feathers, gently sweeping the ground lest they step on an insect. What are the limits of reverence? We make soup, we write tight little narratives where all messy threads are tied up, neatly, at the end. We read books on organizing our home. Rooms turn vast with order,withsimplicity. We have only what we need, what we cherish, and there is a place for everything we own.Possessionsare instantly findable and they are happy to serve us. The stalker destroys time, categories and meaning, locking memories and dreams in the present moment. The mind strains against the body to push thoughts out. Everything is impure. The daily taunts and jeers I experienced as a child are happening right now right here. I’m pooping my guts out,taking slow breaths against the pain. My body is twisting my subjectivity, wringing it out likeone of those old time washing machines my grandmother had. Whenever anyone laughs they are laughing at me. The stalker has brokenthe frame. The process ofwriting this essay creates a new frame that proves I am capable of at least the most basic adult human functioning. How do you express trauma when linearity fails you? You order products online for your enemy. When the past possesses the present you enter the now now now of spurting adrenaline, and your irises spinlike pinwheels. The pix shriek nobody wants you here the pix shriek you are hated everybody hates you. I publish a piece in a journal my stalker has also published in. I imagine her reading it with scorn, searching for bits out of context she can use to destroy me. “Dodie Bellamy said” becomes a tagline to ruin. On_Nashville, Will, the gay character, is being bashed on Twitter and bam! his trauma is my trauma panic blots out the present like one of those bags terrorists shove over a captive’s head. I am forever a child useless andhumiliated. I am a radiant pink clit inflamed bythe eros of my stalker’s loathing. My stalker hates capitalism. I believe she hates capitalism more than she hates me. Headline on the internet: A majority of millennials now reject capitalism, poll shows. My stalker says that if she could have anything in the world she wished for, it would be to destroycapitalism. My stalker believes that by shoplifting items made by slaves in China she is fuckingcapitalism. When I was young I’d shoplift with friends but I was too much of a pussy to do it on my own. My friend Jackie—who was a pro—and I would come home with huge hauls of stuff, most of which I’d end up not wanting, and I had to figure out how to get rid of. Before we went on a run, we’d put on makeup and work dresses and little heels; our aesthetic was clueless middle class bargain hunter. Jackie’s first rule: no backpacks or large purses while shoplifting. We carried moderately-sized shoulder bags. They looked like they couldn’t hold much of anything—but you’d be surprised. I once smashed a fluffy pink prom dress into one. Jackie’s second rule was entitlement. When she found a stainless steel fish poacher she liked, she just picked it up and marched out of Macys with it, and nobody blinked. Despite itsheart-thumping arousal, hours of nonstopshoplifting was exhausting. I felt buried in commodity culture and the treadmill of consumption that drivescapitalism’s insatiable thrust. It was gross.When Jackie and I returned to my apartment, we dumped our haul onto my bed in a jumbled mountain, and then we belly-flopped onto it, shrieking, carefree as dogs rolling around in shit. One night, over a period two hours, thirteenthings were ordered in my name, each from a different website. Then a coupleof hours later, another item, bringing the total to fourteenin one evening. Could one person possibly have ordered this much, this quickly? Or was somebody throwing aHarass Dodie party? I sat down at my desk and started emailing the companies—This order is fraudulent. I also downloaded the product photos per artist friend Kristina Lee Podesva’s suggestion. When I told her about my stalker, excitement spread across Kristina’s face and she exclaimed, “Document this!”The order confirmations were coming in so furiously I couldn’t keep up. I could only imagine that the person on the other end was tweaking. I checked my stalker’s Twitter feed. She tweeted before the ordering frenzy began and then not again until ten or fifteenminutes after it ended,when she wrote—My mother just asked me if I was on heroin. A few minutes later she tweeted—I’m reading inPhiladelphia, if you come bring me flowers—peonies. Peony bulbs were one of the fourteen items. The world goes crazy with connection. I say to my psychic, I think I know who it is, but I’m not sure. My psychic says,you know. My stalker sends me a widow’s walk and a necklace to contain the ashes of a loved one—is she casting a spell of doom on me? What does an office chair mean? It requires work for me to write back to all these companies, but it also requires a hell of a lot of commitment and focused attention for her to order all this stuff. Her curated images are about potential, about our post-industrial condition, in which we sit at machines pushing around bytes, alone, longing to reach out. Glamor shots of merchandise hail her and she clicks them with the grammarless fever of a rat clicking a food-delivery lever. Eventually the image objects arrive on my computer and I click them with confusion and fear and anger, but also with a twinge of pleasure that reminds me of playing Monument Valley, my bumbling attempts to navigate a twisting architecture whose rules endlessly elude. Objects speak with the indeterminacy of a cry, garbledlike puppets with their lips sewn shut. Yet it’s impossible not to narrativize them. To the protest, my stalker wears cotton toddler panties stretched tight across hercooch. Beneath her sheer Diane Von Furstenberg dress, areolas bloom, lush pink peonies.Comrades and government infiltrators alike find her unbearably sexy. Anything you send a writer is a gift. A suicidal young woman pulls up on a motorcycle. I rub her face into mydesiccated crotch, suck the bloomfrom her cheeks and cough up bile. My breath is so foul sperm curdles and young Marxists faint. I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable,/ I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world. Before I became a middle class person I shopped only at thrift stores, so the clothes I owned were jeans, striped long-sleeved tees, and party dresses. When I got my first middle class job, I went to Macys and charged these awfuloutfits—polyester pants suits, etc.—I looked like a clown, a droopy professional clown. The middle class likes different things than the working class, but we all want things things things things—even homeless people in my neighborhood wheel shopping carts and suitcases overflowing with things. If capitalism were destroyed, would the homeless have better things? The viscosity of capitalism swallows us. We are never sure if we are inside or outside of it. It spreads over the globe making things stick together. I walk down the street wearing bits of China India Portugal Vietnam, andoccasionallythe USA. The ghosts of nameless workers vape from my silhouette, rendering me not one but many. My boss said my best middle class outfit was one I shoplifted with Jackie—a navy cashmere shift by Ralph Lauren. For the bourgeois subject wouldn’t guilt be a more appropriate response thanhate? Perhaps guilt is what’s really behind the attacking of those perceived politically impure. Like a game of tag,you spread the cooties to those not deft enough to sidestep your fingering. Anyone who’s seen a zombie movie knows that when capitalism is destroyedwe don’t get utopia. We get poetry bandits who police the perimeters. Law like a person has an unconscious. What my stalker really wants to destroy is the stink of trauma that wafts off of her. I provide a focal point for my stalker’s hate, a manageable target for the all-consuming vastness of her rage. If she didn’t have me, maybe she’d jump off a bridge or shoot up a post office, who knows.It’s the middle of the night and allthis pressure is trapped in her body, enormous pressure she can’t release. She wants to sigh, to scream, to burst out crying. But nothing moves. Stuck in a limbo of angst, where sadness and fury are all mucked up together, ongoing and escalating, my stalkerlooks over her list of enemies. It’s Dodie tonight. People rarely do things just to be wicked—they act because they’re convinced they’ve encountered evil, convinced that innocents need protecting—or they perceive their livelihood is threatened—or a great wrong has been committed against them. Throughout history, horrible things—I don’t need to list them—have been done with God on our side, things that must have felt honorable at the time, but whose cruelty today shocks us. Powerful feelings can fuck you up, especially when fucked-up you feel you have the right to fuck up others. On the internet I read about a guy who stalked a woman for five years. Helen reported 125 incidents of harassment but the police did nothing until he attacked her with a pair of scissors, stabbing her multiple times on the neck, face, and back. It took a lot of googling to find out what Helen did to deserve her “living nightmare.” She met Joseph at a halfway house where she was recovering from an eating disorder. They became friends, until one night Joseph asked Helen to drive him and anotherfriend to see a band called Carnaby Street. Helen didn’t feelup to it and said she’d text him if she changed her mind. Joseph felt stood up, and his affection for Helen instantlyturned into burning hatred. So he vandalized her car, made silent phone calls, left a dead cat on her doorstep, smashed her windows,sent her letters calling her fat and rat-faced, spray-painted Die Helen across a brick wall, nearly killed her. Because she didn’t go to a concert. There is always a reason to destroy another. Anybody who needs a reason will find one. I was my stalker’s favorite writer until I posted a comment on a poet’s Facebook thread, three years ago. Before that I have no memory of having met her or heard of her. Though I think that’s not true;most likely I was in many rooms with her, rooms filled with poetry. I learn from the internet that mobbing should not be confused with gang stalking. Mobbing is perpetrated by a closed, defined group, such as an academic department or poetry community. Gang stalking is perpetrated by government/corporate agencies. Black vans sit outside your apartment, trail you down the street. Satellites beam voices into your brain via nanotechnology implanted in your skull. The voices arerelentless and abrasive. They say everybody hates you. They urge you to harm yourself and others. Eventually you find out you are part of a vast government/corporate experiment whose goal is to break people, and then through mind control to create spies who don’t even know they’re spies. Mind control makes the best kind of spy because no matter how much the targeted individual is tortured, they can’t reveal secretsthey don’t know they have. Their secrets are hidden deep within their brain behind an altar thatonly the programmers know how to unlock. The Russians have implanted nanotechnology inside Trump’s head, and that’s why he does their bidding. The programmers can kill youby remote control, make your heart clench, make you vomit liters of black goo. The whole thing’s set up to look like paranoid schizophrenia sothat targeted individuals aren’t taken seriously. But these people hold conventions and tell their stories to the masses via websites and YouTube videos. Vice made a documentary about them. The psychological torture is so intense, many targeted individuals commit suicide. Some of them give in to the voices and go on a shooting spree.The internet is a cacophony of voices beaming love or hate at you, depending on your age race gender sexual preference body type politics. The internet can gather 2000 signatures against you overnight.You can be condemned on the merest wisp of data. Even if you aren’t the one who committed a crime, if you criticize mob action in the comment section of a poet’s Facebook feed, you’re labeled an apologist and you’re just as evil as the worst rapist or racist, and young womenyou barely know will hate you forever. If you protest they’ll hate you even more. If you block them on Facebook they’ll condemn you for silencing them. They’llpost screenshots of things you’ve written—out of context—and since you’re old and not as online savvy you don’t know how to make each post discrete, like a hologramwith its context imbedded within it rather than depending on other posts for context. Powerful male mentors will boost their slanderous lies about you and no one will come to your defense except Brian Kim Stefans, who lives like a million miles away in Los Angeles. Locals will tell you privately they agree with you and they’re appalled by your treatment but they dare not say anything. And young guys who you thought were your friends will lecture you on your anti-feminist behavior. There’s only one response available to any guy who would lecture you on feminism and that’s fuck off,but still your heart breaks because you cared for them in an age-appropriate way, as if they were cute spaniels with big floppy ears. The poetry community you’ve been devoted to since the early 80s is no longer safe, and even those who didn’t mob you, you see them mobbing others, andthis you cannot abide. On the internet you learn that when someone is directing negative energy at you, you should imagine yourself covered by mirrors and bounce that negative energy back to them. You should ground yourself by drinking chlorophyll, trace minerals, and specially ionized water. By harassing me does my stalker believe she’s saving Poetry or is she merely a sociopath lusting for blood? I read on the internet that stalking is like a long rape. Before such violence there is no place for obliqueness. Every piece I’ve ever written has centered around love, no matter how fucked up its manifestation. But this girl and her actions, I can find no love here to cling to, not even a spark. She’s like that evil queen who fed Snow White the poison apple. She’s a cliché of viciousness the internet has birthed. I sit at the computer fortressed in mirrors, my eyes peering through a narrow slit. I click theMail icon. Something new has been ordered—three jars of moly bore treatment paste. I learn on the internet that your rub this paste on the inside of your rifle barrel in order to reduce friction for minimum fouling, faster, easier cleanup and longer barrel life. My stalker posts Tinder screenshots from interested guys below her league and ridicules them. She posts provocative pictures of herself—flimsy teddies and wisps of panties she can pull aside in order to selfie her ass—andfantasizesthe FBI agents she’s sure are surveilling her because she’s a radical are jerking off to her image. When I was a child Ifantasized God was watching me, and so I would do cute things for God, inspired by the TV show Candid Camera, which made Cold War surveillance culture fun. At any momentyou could step out of ordinary life and do something adorable or amusing enough to be broadcast to all of America. With earbud attached to a coiled cord that trails from ear to back of neck and disappears into their dark jackets, FBI agents are forced to observe you. It is their job to remain professional and implacable, but your dirty talk on Twitter, your skimpy selfies are so damned seductive—flies zip open, well-scrubbed cocks pop out, sunglassed heads arc backwards in rapture.I learn on the internet that people who try to harm you are in fact possessed by negative entities, entities that they areunaware of. Therefore I say to my stalker—You need to ground and clear yourself because you _seem to be possessed. In your latest selfies you look awfully animalistic. You should drink some chlorophyll and wear a lead-lined hoodie to bed to protect yourself from the government/corporate complex that is beaming these terrible thoughts into your head.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The President’s Telegram (3)</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/11-11/The-Presidents-Telegram-3/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The President’s Telegram (3)" /><published>2018-11-01T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-11-01T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/11-11/the-presidents-telegram-3</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/11-11/The-Presidents-Telegram-3/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m telling you that microbes have been reinvented in order to impose a new idea of god.
–Antonin Artaud&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If at first we could not be distinguished from the objects of our perception, and if later our objects came to perceive us better than we them, the only thing left to do was to become imperceptible. Our first inspiration, the siberian actinobacteria, is the oldest known continuously living organism on Earth. It does DNA repair below freezing, indicating it’s been alive, not dormant, in the permafrost for a half-million years. Half-million years of imperceptible life.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The collective took seriously the etymology of culture. Certain microbes practice consensus, and while they may not have what you call a civic life, without them no civic life as such would exist. As had so many visionaries before us, we recognized that &lt;em&gt;we ourselves&lt;/em&gt; (obvious, all too obvious) would not live to see the utopia of the microbes, microorganisms, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and certain worms. Viruses, digital data, memories, particles, ideas, concepts, dreams, organisms that live on electricity, artists so unknown they suspect they are already dead, the half-thought, aleatory and gestural, and ghosts, would thrive. There in the exhale-thin space where the distinction between work and whatever is not work, between entertainment and labor, had eroded, in that space just before upgrades replaced forms, before research replaced concerns, any species or thing that already was, or had the capacity to be imperceptible could find a place in this no-place between dissolving brackets: extremely old rocks at the center of the earth, certain clouds at night early in the life of the planet, utterly ignored loners, the obscure surmises of children known to say things like, “When we’re dead we’ll be able to see what is a dinosaur.”
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Evolutionary principles in The Imperceptible Utopia would differ radically from the normative bio- metaphysics of “natural selection.” There would no longer be anything perceptible to coopt, destroy, then save, coopt, destroy, then save, coopt, destroy, then save.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But in the end, our dream of participation was grandiose. The Imperceptible Utopia had no need of us, none whatsoever. Retroactively, our collective could only be described as half-measured and chimerical. It was not stupid enough to put a car in space, but not smart enough to break news gently. It had the belt but not the patience of a carpenter. It had the quickness but not the commitment of a hummingbird. It had float but lacked reflexivity. It had camouflage but lacked enemies. It had the dream-life of an A.I. and startlingly hot feet of a shoeless tarmac walker in summer in Nevada. It had the purposefulness but not the recall of a pragmatist. It had the fathomless, awe-striking rarity of an unexpectedly ancient jawbone but not the wherewithal to be found. It had falcon eyes, and sloped-racetrack-of-ice slickness, but no real desire to talk.

&lt;br /&gt;
Tenderly,

Remorselessly.

&lt;p sytle=&quot;lline-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;
If you live in your car, I don’t have to worry about you not being able to pay rent
&lt;br /&gt;
If you eat scraps from a dumpster, I don’t have to worry about you stealing food
&lt;br /&gt;
You don’t deserve to put in your misery-filled mouth and fumble down with rotting teeth
&lt;br /&gt;
If you find temporary employment in a warehouse so big that no one knows your name
&lt;br /&gt;
I don’t have to worry about you thinking your life is shit
&lt;br /&gt;
Others with nametags will help you reach that conclusion
&lt;br /&gt;
And if they still have any brains resting inside their misshapen skulls
&lt;br /&gt;
They will inform you that you should have been left out in the rain
&lt;br /&gt;
Because you didn’t save for a rainy day
&lt;br /&gt;
It’s the American way – everyone gets what he or she merits
&lt;br /&gt;
You got here on your own, didn’t you?
&lt;br /&gt;
Down the path of the fallen
&lt;br /&gt;
Is it my fault that you failed spectacularly at being human?
&lt;br /&gt;
That you became another blooming eyesore on this great nation’s scrubbed face
&lt;br /&gt;
There is a good reason that you were drubbed and you know
&lt;br /&gt;
Deep in your worm-filled heart that you got what you earned
&lt;br /&gt;
If you live in your car, I don’t have to worry about where you will sleep at night
&lt;br /&gt;
If you live in your car, I won’t have to concern myself
&lt;br /&gt;
With where you will be found
&lt;br /&gt;
Once you are dead
&lt;br /&gt;
Another petty thought that takes up too much of my precious day
&lt;br /&gt;
When I have the untrammeled happiness of my constituents to think about
&lt;br /&gt;
If you live in your car, I don’t have to worry about the next election
&lt;br /&gt;
Because you will be gone, one way or another
&lt;br /&gt;
