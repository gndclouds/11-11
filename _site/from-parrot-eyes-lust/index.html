I do this
<br />
      I do that
<br /><br />
            hard drive hums a different tune
<br /><br />
More of a growl really
<br /><br />
                 Orphan files recovered
<br /><br />
not unlike                      tips of text
<br />
                        at the top or bottom of page
<br />
<br />
Please wait while this page restarts Dear lovely cursor
<br />
<br />
little line
<br />
from which somehow letters leap forth
<br />
out of which words
<br />
<br />
warp &amp; wave
<br />
&amp; wiggle
<br />
as certain
<br />
as gravity to a waterfall
<br />
here deep in the forest
<br />
Too much Saturn not enough moon
<br />
We knew
<br />
not only that you like
<br />
to ‘pop’ your knuckles
<br />
from Parrot Eyes Lust
<br />
Ron Silliman
<br />
For Elliot Helfer
<br />
but that you do so ‘inside out’ center fingers first
<br />
alternating
<br />
from one hand to the next
<br />
then pointer
<br />
then ring finger
<br />
birds loud in the canopy
<br />
not a hint of the squirrels
<br />
I see one robin
<br />
fat on the lawn
<br />
hard copy is
<br />
at least truthier
<br />
Spot right at the soffit’s edge
<br />
where invariably I hit my head
<br />
Old iron wind chimes
<br />
you can smell the rust
<br />
The rest is time
<br />
already at dawn
<br />
I hear someone’s sprinklers
<br />
Lavender hydrangea
<br />
up against the fence
<br />
Squirrel among birdcalls
<br />
Kiss of the hummingbird
<br />
Who in that house all those kids
<br />
(not seen)
<br />
the girls &amp; their boyfriends reads a book?
<br />
Rabbit in the road
<br />
Last night the first June bugs tonight even more
<br />
Little concrete stupa
<br />
 hidden behind hastas
 <br />
Newspaper ungathered at the driveway’s base
<br />
Pulp of the banana slides down the esophagus
<br />
great lake
<br />
of stomach bacteria
<br />
awaits
<br />
That clicking, kissing sound is the squirrels
<br />
hum of the first weekend pilot
<br />
Sun suddenly
<br />
casts its shadow
<br />
Hundreds of tiny flying things
<br />
so small
<br />
you wouldn’t even notice
<br />
but for this
<br />
moment of illumination
<br />
Dog’s moan
<br />
so particular I even know
<br />
which dog
<br />
now, somewhere in the mix a rock dove coos
I know who he was
<br />
but never really read him
<br />
didn’t notice
<br />
that he’d disappeared
<br />
let alone that you’d died
<br />
now, 21 years later these brilliant poems shimmer in the light
<br />
“pain free”
<br />
I hear my son yawn two rooms away
<br />
The rain appears to have stopped
<br />
but that bird’s returned with its 5-note song
<br />
Dear Philip,
<br />
it’s 5:03 AM
<br />
nine hours west of here
<br />
three hours west of Hawai’i
<br />
I have to be careful now
<br />
at the sight of the slightest spider
<br />
It might be you
<br />
At dawn
<br />
one finds moths
<br />
gathered at the sink
<br />
This gigantic notebook
<br />
Gradually the poem unveils itself
<br />
<br />
 well not the light exactly this gray paper
 <br />
starting to darken with age
<br />
These beach houses furnished all alike
<br />
pastels too bright
<br />
seashell decorations
<br />
&amp; the promise
<br />
of an outdoor shower
<br />
The “girl” at the market made me happy
<br />
with her Russian accent
<br />
The compost of America becoming that much more rich
<br />
The joints of my legs conjoin with the pelvis
<br />
where just to sit still is not entirely
<br />
 A pickup truck
 <br />
in whose bed stand
<br />
upright tied tight
<br />
(bright orange straps) a dozen glass doors
<br />
Today’s first jogger
<br />
heading west along the canal
<br />
on a side street the first power walker
<br />
heading south
<br />
Another jogger
<br />
(the first guy)
<br />
trotting thru these long shadows
<br />
he’s heading north
<br />
Nobody yet
<br />
walking their dog
<br />
tho I hear one
<br />
a few doors away
<br />
The one we call Psycho Dog loves to hurl himself
<br />
against the electronic fence
<br />
This jogger returns limping
<br />
O very pale golden lab
<br />
nose down
<br />
checking the odors
<br />
as it walks
<br />
Majestic blue heron threads the sky
<br />
Quick enough rain storm
<br />
but now all the lawn chairs are soaked
<br />
Quiet enough
<br />
I can hear the guy next door
<br />
talking on the phone
<br /></p>

<p>“Okay”
<br />
he says
<br />
accenting each syllable the second drawn out
<br />
nearly becomes two
<br />
An old cheese stick in the car just as good as ever
<br />
What are the lines
<br />
What are the words
<br />
I need
<br />
<br />
<br />
to make sense
<br />
<br />
of my life?
<br />
<br />
right at the edge
<br />
<br />
about to recognize a feeling
<br />
<br />
&amp; you! meaning me
<br />
<br />
you had to jump right in you always do that
<br />
<br />
But it’s not I wanted to say later
<br />
<br />
driving the dark road north it’s not about feeling
<br />
<br />
Y has so many
<br />
<br />
he’s paralyzed by the weight of them
<br />
<br />
it’s about doing
<br />
<br />
he needs to do something
<br />
<br />
Anything at all
<br />
<br />
Giant yellow telescope at midtown highrise window
<br />
<br />
not for the sky
<br />
<br />
but to glimpse neighbors fucking
<br />
<br />
The lone skylight was in the second bathroom
<br />
<br />
A pile of towels where I hope to sit
<br />
<br />
hop to site
<br />
<br />
Oooh, scolds X,
<br />
<br />
he was right there
<br />
<br />
 How to position
 <br />
 <br />
<br />
the cycle of texts
<br />
like knowing
<br />
for each line
<br />
where to draw
<br />
the left margin
<br />
This howl is my Howl dog’s growl
<br />
inflected by wagging tail
<br />
Hail to the clef Cliff note
<br />
Smallest distance between beats of the heart
<br />
I saw my mother married only as a toddler
<br />
Try to fathom now
<br />
all the difference
<br />
that’s made
<br />
A tall page
<br />
to stand for ages Truman is still President
<br />
Tho I don’t yet know
<br />
quite what that means
<br />
If a fountain pen
<br />
where then is the fountain?
<br />
The soprano sings
<br />
Come All Ye Fair &amp; Tender Maidens
<br />
while the baritone with somewhat less flash
<br />
intones On Top Of Old Smoky
<br />
the percussion quartet hyperactive but surprisingly quiet
<br />
more space between notes than within
<br />
What one hears decades on
<br />
will differ
<br />
 An auditorium filled with white hair
 <br />
(Who will hear George Crumb
<br />
once his generation’s gone?)
<br />
I don’t sculpt Google nor ogle giggles
<br />
but each letter is somehow carved
<br />
from what? from who?
<br />
from how
<br />
From here I look out on a room that my children
<br />
might imagine as primal as I do that one
<br />
gone so long ago
<br />
The television in the corner to the right of the fireplace
<br />
in front of a case
<br />
filled with books
<br />
The Big Book of Little Stanzas
<br />
including the one
<br />
I thought last night
<br />
to write
<br />
right here
<br />
Bowl of frozen meatballs microwaved
<br />
for my son’s breakfast
<br />
fills the air eau d’ meat
<br />
The great busyness of dreams does not survive
<br />
the violence
<br />
of the electronic toothbrush
<br />
placed in one’s head
<br />
What was I doing?
<br />
Am I doing it still?
<br />
Few &amp; far between
<br />
expectations of privacy
<br />
2 hidden assumptions the line, the margin
<br />
An old song from World War I
<br />
By using a notebook, do I become quaint?
<br />
Magnetized hooks
<br />
on the side of the fridge
<br />
Some Civil War vets still were alive
<br />
when I was a child
<br />
The “paper boy”
<br />
is a middle-aged man
<br />
in a large sedan
<br />
Over There
<br />
 Some threat to the dream but vague
 <br />
&amp; not immediate
<br />
So that all I recall
<br />
is the desert climate
<br />
warm but not oppressive the sun in great quantity
<br />
Word order in Turkish
<br />
matters far less
<br />
enabling different forms of play
<br />
Man bites dog well not quite
<br />
With that much room
<br />
I’d never back out of the driveway
<br />
The Age of Melted Wax
<br />
NCIS
<br />
not the agency
<br />
the show is all about
<br /></p>

<p>you could track the history
<br />
not just of
<br />
retail capital
<br />
but of technology itself through the rise
<br />
&amp; later demise
<br />
of the video store
<br />
Tasteless “dots” marketed as
<br />
The Future of Ice Cream
<br />
The way the Beats distrusted
<br />
Ferlinghetti’s sense of business
<br />
while sending City Lights their manuscripts
<br />
Each sentence fills with sorrow
<br />
What if history itself should not endure?
<br />
Joe Brainard’s
<br />
Nancy as an ashtray
<br />
reflects a curious misogyny
<br />
A bias
<br />
in haiku
<br />
against titles
<br />
&amp; long boots
<br />
Who reads
<br />
Rod McKuen now?
<br />
I climb the long stairs
<br />
to the floor on which
<br />
in the far rear corner they stock poetry
<br />
Outside, from a card table an old couple
<br />
sell plates from Iznik A young man pops in my face
<br />
The winter of short skirts
<br />
 to implore
 <br />
Will you save a mountain tonight?
<br /></p>
