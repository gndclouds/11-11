  I do this

             hard drive hums a different tune

 More of a growl really

          Dear lovely cursor
<br />
<br />
                 little line
<br />
<br />
 from which somehow letters leap forth
<br />
 out of which words
<br />
<br />
                warp &amp; wave
<br />
<br />
           &amp; wiggle
<br />
<br />
 as certain
<br />
 as gravity to a waterfall
<br />
<br />
                     here deep in the forest
<br />
<br />
                          Too much Saturn not enough moon
<br />
                     We knew
<br />
<br />
           not only that you like
<br />
                to ‘pop’ your knuckles
<br />
 but that you do so ‘inside out’
<br />
           center fingers first
<br />
                alternating

           from one hand to the next
<br />
<br />
      then pointer

                then ring finger

<br />
 birds loud in the canopy
<br />
<br />
                not a hint of the squirrels
<br />
                I see one robin
<br />
                     fat on the lawn
<br />
<br />
 hard copy is
<br />
 at least truthier
<br />
<br />
                               Spot
<br />
                          right at the soffit’s edge
<br />
                          where invariably
<br />
      I hit my head
<br />
<br />
 Old iron wind chimes
<br />
           you can smell the rust
<br />
<br />
           The rest is time
<br />
<br />
                already at dawn
<br />
             I hear someone’s sprinklers
<br />
<br />
          Lavender hydrangea
<br />
                up against the fence
<br />
<br />
 Squirrel among birdcalls
<br />
<br />
    Kiss of the hummingbird (not seen)
<br />
<br />
    Who in that house
<br />
          all those kids
<br />
             the girls &amp; their boyfriends
<br />
       reads a book?
 <br />
<br />
          Rabbit in the road
<br />
<br />
    Last night the first June bugs
<br />
       tonight even more
<br />
<br />
          Little concrete stupa

 hidden behind hastas
<br />
<br />
       Newspaper ungathered
<br />
    at the driveway’s base
<br />
<br />
                Pulp of the banana
<br />
             slides down the esophagus
<br />
                great lake
<br />
                of stomach bacteria
<br />
                   awaits
<br />
<br />
 That clicking, kissing sound
<br />
       is the squirrels
<br />
<br />
             hum of the first
<br />
                   weekend pilot
<br />
<br />
    Sun suddenly
<br />
       casts its shadow
<br />
<br />
          Hundreds of tiny
<br />
             flying things
<br />
                so small
<br />
             you wouldn’t even notice
<br />
          but for this
<br />
             moment of illumination
<br />
<br />
       Dog’s moan
<br />
          so particular
<br />
          I even know
<br />
          which dog
<br />
<br />
             now, somewhere in the mix
<br />
                a rock dove coos
<br />
<br />
 I know who he was
<br />
 but never really read him
<br />
<br />
 didn’t notice
<br />
 that he’d disappeared
<br />
<br />
          let alone that you’d died
<br />
<br />
 now, 21 years later
<br />
 these brilliant poems
<br />
 shimmer in the light
<br />
             well not the light exactly
<br />
             this gray paper
<br />
             starting to darken with age
<br />
 These beach houses
<br />
       furnished all alike
<br />
    pastels too bright
<br />
          seashell decorations
<br />
       &amp; the promise
<br />
                of an outdoor shower
<br />
<br />
                The “girl” at the market
<br />
             made me happy
<br />
                   with her Russian accent
<br />
<br />
                   The compost of America
<br />
             becoming that much more rich
<br />
<br />
                   The joints of my legs
<br />
             conjoin with the pelvis
<br />
             where just to sit still
<br />
                is not entirely
<br />
                      “pain free”
<br />
<br />
 This gigantic notebook
<br />
<br />
       Gradually the poem
<br />
          unveils itself
<br />
       I hear my son yawn
<br />
                two rooms away
<br />
<br />
       The rain appears to have stopped
<br />
<br />
          but that bird’s returned
<br />
       with its 5-note song
<br />
<br />
          Dear Philip,
<br />
             it’s 5:03 AM
<br />
             nine hours west of here
<br />
             three hours west of Hawai’i
<br />
<br />
    I have to be careful now
<br />
             at the sight of the slightest spider
<br />
                It might be you
<br />
<br />
                   At dawn
<br />
                one finds moths
<br />
                      gathered at the sink
<br />
<br />
       A pickup truck
<br />
          in whose bed stand
<br />
                upright
<br />
             tied tight
<br />
                (bright orange straps)
<br />
             a dozen glass doors
<br />
<br />
       Today’s first jogger
<br />
             heading west along the canal
<br />
<br />
                on a side street the first power walker
<br />
                heading south
<br />
<br />
          Another jogger
<br />
             (the first guy)
<br />
             trotting thru
<br />
          these long shadows
<br />
<br />
                he’s heading north
<br />
<br />
          Nobody yet
<br />
             walking their dog
<br />
          tho I hear one
<br />
                a few doors away
<br />
<br />
 The one we call Psycho Dog
<br />
       loves to hurl himself
<br />
          against the electronic fence
<br />
<br />
             This jogger returns
<br />
                limping
<br />
<br />
       O very pale
 <br />
          golden lab
<br />
       nose down
<br />
          checking the odors
<br />
          as it walks
<br />
<br />
       Majestic blue heron
<br />
          threads the sky
<br />
<br />
             Quick enough rain storm
<br />
          but now all the lawn chairs are soaked
<br />
<br />
          Quiet enough
<br />
          I can hear the guy next door
<br />
       talking on the phone
<br />
          “Okay”
<br />
             he says
<br />
                accenting each syllable
<br />
             the second drawn out
<br />
             nearly becomes two
<br />
<br />
 An old cheese stick in the car
<br />
 just as good as ever
<br />
<br />
                   What are the lines
<br />
                      What                         are the words
<br />
                         I need
<br />
                         to make sense
<br />
                         of my life?
<br />
<br />
       Oooh, scolds X,
<br />
          he was right there
<br />
             right at the edge
<br />
                about to recognize a feeling
<br />
<br />
     &amp; you!
<br />
     meaning me
<br />
                 you had to jump right in
<br />
                 you always do that
<br />
<br />
                         But it’s not
<br />
                     I wanted to say later
<br />
                 driving the dark road north
<br />
     it’s not about feeling
<br />
                     Y has so many
<br />
             he’s paralyzed by the weight of them
<br />
         it’s about doing
<br />
             he needs to do something
<br />
                 Anything at all
<br />
<br />
                 Giant yellow telescope
<br />
             at midtown highrise window
<br />
                 not for the sky
<br />
             but to glimpse neighbors fucking
<br />
<br />
                     The lone skylight
<br />
         was in the second bathroom
<br />
<br />
                             A pile of towels
 <br />
                    
 where I hope to sit
<br />
<br />
                     hop to sit
<br />
<br />
                         How to position
<br />
                             the cycle of texts
<br />
<br />
                     like knowing
<br />
                         for each line
<br />
                     where to draw
<br />
                         the left margin
<br />
<br />
 This howl is my Howl
<br />
         dog’s growl
<br />
             inflected by wagging tail
<br />
<br />
             Hail to the clef
<br />
 Cliff note
<br />
<br />
             Smallest distance between
<br />
                 beats of the heart
<br />
<br />
                     I saw my mother married
<br />
                 only as a toddler
<br />
<br />
                 Try to fathom now
<br />
                 all the difference
<br />
                 that’s made
<br />
<br />
 A tall page
<br />
 to stand for ages
<br />
 Truman is still President
<br />
<br />
         Tho I don’t yet know
<br />
             quite what that means
<br />
<br />
        If a fountain pen
<br />
            where then is the fountain?
<br />
<br />
            The soprano sings
<br />
        Come All <em>Ye Fair &amp; Tender Maidens</em>
<br />
                while the baritone
<br />
                with somewhat less flash
<br />
            intones <em>On Top</em>
<br />
        <em>Of Old Smoky</em>
<br />
                the percussion quartet
<br />
        hyperactive but surprisingly quiet
<br />
            more space between notes
<br />
            than within
<br />
<br />
    What one hears
<br />
        decades on
<br />
            will differ
<br />
An auditorium filled
<br />
        with white hair
<br />
            (Who will hear
<br />
        George Crumb
<br />
        once his generation’s gone?)
<br />
<br />
I don’t sculpt Google
<br />
    nor ogle giggles
<br />
            but each letter
<br />
        is somehow carved
<br />
    from what?
<br />
        from who?
<br />
    from how
<br />
<br />
From here I look out on a room
<br />
        that my children
<br />
            might imagine as primal
<br />
        as I do that one
<br />
gone so long ago
<br />
<br />
            The television in the corner
<br />
        to the right of the fireplace
<br />
    in front of a case
<br />
            filled with books
<br />
<br />
                    The Big Book
<br />
                of Little Stanzas
<br />
<br />
            including the one
<br />
                I thought last night
<br />
            to write
<br />
                right here
<br />
<br />
Bowl of frozen meatballs
<br />
microwaved
<br />
for my son’s breakfast
<br />
        fills the air
<br />
eau d’ meat
<br />
<br />
        The great busyness of dreams
<br />
    does not survive
<br />
            the violence
<br />
        of the electronic toothbrush
<br />
                placed in one’s head
<br />
<br />
    What was I doing?
<br />
<br />
                Am I doing it still?
<br />
<br />
    Some threat to the dream
<br />
            but vague
<br />
    &amp; not immediate
<br />
<br />
    So that all I recall
<br />
        is the desert climate
<br />
            warm but not oppressive
<br />
        the sun in great quantity
<br />
<br />
Word order in Turkish
<br />
matters far less
<br />
enabling different forms of play
<br />
<br />
                    Man bites dog
<br />
                        well not quite
<br />
<br />
                    With that much room
<br />
                    I’d never back out of the driveway
<br />
<br />
                    The Age of Melted Wax
<br />
<br />
                        NCIS
<br />
                        not the agency
<br />
                            the show is all about
<br />
                        expectations of privacy
<br />
<br />
Few &amp; far between
<br />
                                2 hidden assumptions
<br />
                                    the line, the margin
<br />
                                    An old song
<br />
                                from World War I
<br />
                                    <em>Over There</em>
<br />
<br />
By using a notebook, do I become quaint?
<br />
<br />
        Magnetized hooks
<br />
            on the side of the fridge
<br />
        Some Civil War vets
<br />
            still were alive
<br />
                when I was a child
<br />
<br />
        The “paper boy”
<br />
            is a middle-aged man
<br />
        in a large sedan
<br />
<br />
            you could track
<br />
        the history
<br />
    not just of
<br />
        retail capital
<br />
    but of technology itself
<br />
        through the rise
<br />
            &amp; later demise
<br />
                of the video store
<br />
<br />
    Tasteless “dots”
<br />
        marketed as
<br />
            The Future of Ice Cream
<br />
<br />
The way the Beats distrusted
<br />
Ferlinghetti’s sense of business
<br />
while sending City Lights their manuscripts
<br />
<br />
                        Each sentence fills with sorrow
<br />
                    What if history itself
<br />
                        should not endure?
<br />
            Joe Brainard’s
<br />
                <em>Nancy as an ashtray</em>
<br />
                    reflects a curious misogyny
<br />
                                A bias
<br />
                                 in haiku
<br />
                                againt titles
<br />
<br />
                    The winter of
<br />
                    short skirts
<br />
                        &amp; long boots
<br />
                Who reads
<br />
                Rod McKuen now?
<br />
            I climb the long stairs
<br />
                to the floor on which
<br />
                    in the far rear corner
<br />
                they stock poetry
<br />
        Outside, from a card table
<br />
            an old couple
<br />
                sell plates from Iznik
<br />
        A young man pops in my face
<br />
to implore
<br />
        Will you save a mountain tonight?
<br />
<br /></p>
