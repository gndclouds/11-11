However one might be listening the atmosphere glistens. “Is that photo of her dying?” “No. she’s alive and smiling.” A kind of treaty to attend to this penning of what’s heard. The blank stare stamps, what’s out there seized. An elegant sheet of rain exquisite in its glow. “Where are you?” “Where do the animals go?” Nature droops weighted from water and yet more beautiful “Which outfit is prettier?” Neon pink and silver lines drown the peeping leaves. Aware and noting material is barely responding. Aware the end is near. Not a sheet of rain but shiny pane of glass." />

A certain type of light illumines
<br />
and yet that word is lost.
<br />
It could be a hearse
<br />
but it is too short
<br />
and sporty.
<br />
The door is glue blue.
<br />
That’s what comes to mind. Illness.
<br />
The blue door is at the bottom
<br />
of the brown building to mark
<br />
an entrance.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The breeze.
<br />
The trees
<br />
oblige.
<br />
Be still.
<br />
Appease
<br />
my heart
<br />
my
<br />
nerve
<br />
long
<br />
gone.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
They ask if I’ll put them in the ground,
<br />
if I’ll put myself in the ground.
<br />
If I stare at two buildings I won’t go anywhere
<br />
but below is what looks like brush,
<br />
wiry plants slanting where the sun
<br />
ascends. Miraculously all remain
<br />
still, though her cry tilts the words
<br />
so slightly. The leaning tower
<br />
appears; the cry
<br />
subsides.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To be about this.
<br />
Resistance bites.
<br />
I stretch into limits.
<br />
The wall of green sprawls.
<br />
Each at its own.
<br />
The green holds light
<br />
refracting.
<br />
Blinded by
<br />
a mind’s
<br />
eye.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To want to hold it.
<br />
Raging at you though pursuit is futile.
<br />
That raging sea, desire.
<br />
Three new mouths shot from above
<br />
the nest sharpening its beak.
<br />
Satiation strung from the building-scape.
<br />
The work will wait and work while waiting.
<br />
It becomes about death around now.
<br />
<em>Oh</em> <em>you.</em>
<br />
To affix the loss away from.
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
“Buuuhrd.” The bird house sits transmitting light.
<br />
What a sight the sky. Those are clouds.
<br />
A brown vine straggles. Giggle.
<br />
But why think progressively. A habit
<br />
of the human, you mean “hum.” I’m done
<br />
with moving fast. At last, alas. Your curls
<br />
all atopple. That tree a steeple.
<br />
What would one do with names of species?
<br />
The science blinks
<br />
at the scientist’s swagger.

<br />
<br />
Who are the bad guys raise your hand.
<br />
Well understandably you can’t acquire assertiveness
<br />
just by thinking. The milky sky retreats and she
<br />
eats words. However one might be listening
<br />
the atmosphere glistens.
<br />
“Is that photo of her dying?” “No. she’s alive
<br />
and smiling.” A kind of treaty to attend to
<br />
this penning of what’s heard. The blank
<br />
stare stamps, what’s out there
<br />
seized.

An elegant sheet of rain exquisite in its glow.
<br />
“Where are you?”
<br />
“Where do the animals go?”
<br />
Nature droops weighted from water and yet more
<br />
beautiful “Which outfit is prettier?”
<br />
Neon pink and silver lines drown the peeping
<br />
leaves. Aware and noting material is barely
<br />
responding.
<br />
Aware the end is near.
<br />
Not a sheet of rain but shiny pane of glass.
