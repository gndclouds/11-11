I looked in my bank account
<br />
<br />
It said, “you have five toilets to your name.”
<br />
It said, “don’t just sit there. Return fire.”
<br />
<br />
Talking head says, “go to sleep children. You will all be police tomorrow.”
<br />
<br />
We say: No. We will be the poor.
<br />
<br />
Talking head says, “ok scumbags, I talked to you like children; now you will be dogs”
<br />
<br />
“Market Street” is the best two-word joke I have ever heard in San Francisco
<br />
<br />
“Now I have to teach myself how to pass out sketches and throw pencils at pigeons when I retire”
<br /><br />
“I don’t have any friends who would reprimand me anyway”
<br />
“Retire to the ocean and walk backwards into the surf<br />pretending to fight off the weirdly dressed hordes”
 <br />
 <br /></p>
<p style="text-align:right; font-size:18px;"> -and I used to joke about being underwater.</p>

<p><br />
Laughed at the people stealing my cigarettes
<br />
Laughed at the people pretending to tie my shoes
<br />
<br />
“now I have to put charcoal under the classroom and do impossible things with tap water”
<br />
<br />
“leave the window open so that the most respectful rats will come in and white enlightenment will have something to ponder.”
<br />
<br />
-oh what machines may come
<br />
<br />
“I should have never quit heroin,” we all say (all of the time)
<br />
<br />
we started early.
<br />
twenty wagons appeared in a dream I had about the 7th grade.
<br />
<br />
Pathology needs a god to represent it to children and child like states
<br />
<br />
<em>Eat your people today</em>
<br />
<br />
<em>The top of the tornado starts under our shoe soles</em>
<br />
<em>And touches down on prison farms</em>
<br />
<em>Bibles offer no explanation</em>
<br />
<em>But one cool preacher has quite a laugh</em>
<br />
<br />
<em>All looked up at our beautiful shoes</em></p>

<p style="text-align:right; font-size:18px;">
“You still keep that knife in the car.”
<br />
-the reality is
<br />
that I am awake
<br />
and listening to an
<br />
argument outside
<br />
half listening
<br />
half fighting alongside
<br />
-the reality is
<br />
that I am built
<br />
to protect religion,
<br />
but not all of the time
<br />
<br />
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:18px;">
“I was watching her on my hands”
<br />
“even my imagination just sat there”
<br />
<br />
“the entire crowd did not take a sip for twenty minutes”
<br />
<br />
-the choir is done with you
<br />
done with all of us
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
<em>“We call those projects ‘The Jar’”</em>
<br />
<em>the private said to himself</em>
<br />
<em>while working on his birthday</em>
<br />
<br />

<br />
<em>we said as we aimed</em>
<br />
<br />
<em>“lie down right over there.</em>

<br />
<br />
<em>-the rest of the crash course came in the morning</em>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:18px;">
“like you’ve never seen this card trick before
<br />
the one where your grandfather appears
<br />
<br />
and throws a couple of people into a fire”
<br />
<br />
-just let it rockslide into that shot glass
<br />
<br />
I should have talked to her
<br />
<br />
instead I threw my whole life away
<br />
<br />
I turned my back on my people, Lord
<br />
<br />
left them for a trip up three flights of stairs
<br />
<br />
now the whole freak show is on the back of my hand
<br />
<br />
including capitalists looking up at the sky
<br />
</p>
<p><em>what fascists are determined to do</em>
<br />
<em>does not scare most people</em>
<br />
<br />
<em>it makes most people bored,</em>
<br />

<br />
<br /></p>
<p style="text-align:right; font-size:18px;">
Dear grandfather,
<br />
<br />
I met some bluesmen today.
<br />
Vanquished them all.
<br />
I declared, “your lady is with you,
<br />
but all these chairs in here
<br />
are mine.”
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Before I opened the door to the street
<br />
           I knocked
<br />
                  And the world let me in
<br />
<br />
Stumbled outside
<br />
And there were miles and miles
<br />
Of chalk outlines and window curtains
<br />
littered across the earth’s city
<br /></p>

<p style="text-align:right; font-size:18px;">
Dear Bluesmen,
<br />
Now I am deader than you.
<br />
Please take your seats.
<br />
-the title of our song
<br />
