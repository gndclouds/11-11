Coal mine comedian:
<br />
                              Laugh
<br />
                              Die a little
<br />
                              Laugh
<br />
<br />
His feet up on some table
<br />
they used to sacrifice friendly people on
<br />
      “feet first this time,” I laugh when he says
<br />
<br />
“I’ll be driving out of town for the next five minutes”
<br />
-how we relate to our modern posture
<br />
<br />
“I’ll take a room with a view of the alley, please”
<br />
“I will turn half the tv on”
<br />
“I’ve been human too long tonight… and it’s barely tonight.”
<br />
“Sipping from this bottle I’ve taken to calling a borrowed book”
<br />
<br />
He writes free like… friendless like
<br />
“I know what I am doing,” said his character
<br />
“I know what I am doing,” repeated the writer
<br />
“This fight might help,” said his character
<br />
“This fight might help,” lied the writer
<br />
<br />
writing about the twigs of modern nationalism
<br />
the country goes away first…then third
<br />
<br />
barracks and precincts de-people
<br />
<br />
a country dismantled with syringes (even tweezers)
<br />
<br />
a poorly narrated knife toss (and theory)
<br />
-neither curse nor trophy
<br />
<br />
new york city banister
<br />
singing some funk/
<br />
the man sings down the stairs
<br />
silent when he opens the trunk
<br />
<br />
“I clean up well and will be the only person in heaven”
<br />
<br />
on the diabolically grown side of town
<br />
watching people and hanging onto every shift in weight
<br />
he likes the concept of fathers
<br />
his hands make good city mortar
<br />
wondering when remorse will wear off
<br />
wondering who sent that basket of rats
<br />
<br />
he’s forgot what world he’s parallel too
<br />
<br />
the barcode got good to him
<br />
<br />
“Underwater is where I say I grew up
<br />
when I have run out of things to say”
<br />
<br />
Wit got us dinner
<br />
Or so the last conversation
<br />
Was supposed to keep us alive
<br />
“I wasn’t always in heaven like this”
<br />
<br />
“Man, you are a city-less light show… a bargain shopper in Paris”
<br />
<br /></p>
